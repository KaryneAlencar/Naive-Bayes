Cadaverine or putrescine is found in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. Organisms are strictly anaerobic mesophiles with fermentative metabolism. Glucose and fructose are mainly metabolized to acetic and propionic acids. H2S and acetoin and occasionally minor amounts of succinic acid are produced. Cells do not synthesize cytochrome oxidase, desulfoviridin or indole, hydrolyse arginine or gelatin or reduce nitrate. The G+C content of the DNA is 38–41 mol%.

None of this makes any sense. Here are a few of the most obvious problems:\n\nWe have a firm understanding of the nature of anti-matter and how it interacts. We know that dark matter does not interact that way as there would be a huge number of 511 keV x-rays which are not seen. We also know that the dark matter self-interaction is not too large which is inconsistent with known dark matter properties. We also know that dark matter is largely invisible (does not interact with light) while anti-matter does interact with light exactly the same amount as regular matter.,Physics

"1. I don't know much about sublingual liquid forumulations, but I believe that the active ingredient would need to either already be in solution or be delivered as a micronized powder in suspension. In the latter case, the smaller particles would presumably dissolve readily.\n2. The vitamins you refer to are not ""attached"" to the excipients, they are ""aggregated"" together which is a physical phenomenon. Think of the vitamin as a marble being placed in a cup with smaller beads (the excipient), then add some flour and water and the resulting clump is analogous how the drug is formulated. That said, yes, the vitamin will release from the clump and enter the bloodstream.\n3. I don't understand your third question. A nebulizer works by converting a liquid or suspension containing the vitamin into a fine mist which is inhaled into the lungs. If it's a suspension, the particulates are extremely fine and when deposited in the lungs, allow the vitamin to cross the alveolar and fine bronchial membranes into surrounding tissues and the bloodstream.",Biology

"Why does it feel like I'm doing your homework?  For your body to use them it needs to be broken down to individual atoms or molecules not particles.  You are probably better off posting to r/Chemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against.  You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another.  The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible.  That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur.  It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process.  Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting.  Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules.  Again at this point you are really talking chemistry more than biology.

">i mean what do you think inflaton fields are, or higgs symmetry breaking, if not gigantic hacks?\n\nI feel like this is a category mistake.  The problems that the inflationary hypothesis solves are legitimate problems that don't appear to have any simpler solution at the present time.  However, the main problem that MOND was introduced to solve has an adequate and vastly simpler alternative solution (dark matter), and these days MOND doesn't even fully solve that problem on its own and still needs some dark matter to match observations.\n\nSo, you're calling what is arguably the simplest solution to a set of real problems a ""gigantic hack"" while comparing it to a non-solution to a different problem that already has a much simpler solution.\n\nAt the end of the day, we need an actual solution to things like the horizon problem.  The phrasing you used to characterize inflation makes it sound like you would consider *any* solution to be a ""hack"" simply because it would be more complicated than current models without any solution, and that seems misguided.  What sort of solution to the horizon problem *wouldn't* you consider to be a gigantic hack?",Physics

Chemical inhibitors are added during manufacture.\n\nWhen the plastic ages, the UV absorbers stop working and an oxygen molecule will snatch a single hydrogen atom from the plastic molecule.  The molecule then slightly re-arranges into a yellow coloured new molecule.  Overall: the plastic has irreversibly lost a small part of itself but not enough to change the size of the brick.\n\nAdding peroxide + UV introduces more even stronger radicals - BAM! kick it up a notch.  They attack the yellow polymer only at the site that is missing a hydrogen atom and essentially chop it in half. No more yellow coloured molecule.\n\nDownside is the polymer is no longer elastic.  It's brittle.  What you un-intentionally end up doing is scraping off that tiny thin brittle layer to expose fresh plastic underneath.\n\nYou can repeat the process many times so long as you have material remaining.  It's almost exactly like sandpaper over a wooden floor to expose a fresh surface.  And yes, you can do it so many times but not infinite times.

There's a couple of characteristics of a good catalyst IMO.\n\nSelectivity is one. Meaning it does the desired transformation 99% of the time or more. Imagine doing a reaction an the kilotonne scale. Lower selectivity means more waste and a 1% drop there is a lot of waste.\n\nTurnover number is another. How many molecules of reactant are converted to product in a second? Catalase is the one that comes to mind as the best here.\n\nStability is the last one that I'd consider. How long can the catalyst perform before it becomes inactive? Sometimes the catalyst can be regenerated like zeolites but you still want to be able to either stay in an active state or be stable enough to regenerate from an inactive state.,Chemistry

"I think the word you're looking for is altruism, and act of compassion towards another unrelated organism with little to no regard for the risk to oneself or compensation of such an act. In humans it is evident, although there is an ongoing debate on whether an act can be truly altruistic given that, on a subconscious level, it is almost exclusively beneficial to be compassionate towards others, that is in most circumstances being kind to others earns us positive endorphins, a feeling of satisfaction when you help someone you don't know, which is the pinnacle of evolution in social animals. We are hard wired to sacrifice for others due to the parent-offspring bond which is so strong it extends to other potentially unrelated people and even other species. The same can be said for cetaceans, which are not far behind us in terms of social evolution. Although they may not be aware, or even capable of being aware of a potential payoff for helping a distressed swimmer at their own risk (although they likely do have these cognitive capabilites, at least where it concerns helping unrelated members of their own species), their social cognition is also hard wired to aid conspecifics and other creatures (humans, seals, other whales) based on their cognitively advanced awareness of present danger and the panicked behaviour of the organism in distress. Again, the payoff is positive endorphins rather than, let's say, the abstract idea of ""I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine"". I'm not sure this meta study has been done, but I would hypothesise that the greater sociality of a species, the greater frequency of acts deemed to be altruistic will be seen in that species, which simply means the more social an animal is, the more it will behave in a selfless manner towards non-related organisms. But again, there is a reward whether you're aware of it or not, that being positive endorphins. One is certainly aware of the positive effect these endorphins have on the body and mind, and being aware of this benefit thus calls into question the ""selfless"" nature of putting yourself at risk for others.

"I don't feel there is any value to giving Hirsch anything. Perhaps it is technically required, but Hirsch is *not operating in good faith.* It does not *advance the cause of scientific truth*. A crank asking for the data is just useless noise and a distraction and, for that matter, so is this discussion.\n\nIf some rule forces scientists to deal with cranks without advancing the actual discovery of scientific truth, the rule is in this case not a positive one. The net contribution of Hirsch to the study of superconductivity is *negative.* A rule which allows him to badger any experimentalist in the field is a bad one.\n\nThis is independent of whether Dias completely made up his results or not: Hirsch is not going to provide any insight into that, and it's not possible for us to decide it either. It's going to be other actual experimentalists working with materials like this who will either succeed or fail to reproduce the behavior.\n\n> . I’d be much more convinced about CSH if they’d refute the issues he brought up instead of ignore them. They’ve been accused of the highest crime in academia, prove Hirsch wrong and sink him forever.\n\nThis is silly. It's not going to happen. Hirsch is not making any recognizable scientific claim: he's just saying ""fraud, they are jerks, I don't believe it, I think BCS is full of crap, blah, blah, blah"". You can't just say the right magic words and stun Hirsch into silence with the power of data. \n\nAnd you can't ""sink him"": I think his reputation is probably as low as can be in the actual community of active researchers. But there are channels like arxiv and non-peer-reviewed journals and r/physics where even cranks get heard.\n\nScience doesn't happen like a superhero flick where Galileo goes to the Pope and mutters ""eppur si muove"" and by the end of the movie scientific truth has triumphed and the Pope has to slink off, defeated.

Excluding halogens, heteroaromatic oxygen, sulfur and pyrrole nitrogen. Excluding higher oxidation levels of N, P, or S. Including P(III).\n* Morgan fingerprint rules: any aliphatic O (or S) with a valence of 2 with no attached hydrogens; any aliphatic O (or S) with a charge of -1; any aliphatic N with a valence of 3 as long as it's not attached to a carbon that's double bonded to an O, N, S, or P; any neutral aromatic O (or S) as long as it's not attached to an aromatic N or an aromatic C that's attached to an aromatic N; any aliphatic O (or S) with a valence of 2 and 1 attached hydrogen as long as there isn't a C double bonded to N, S, O, or P within 2 bond lengths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are just a few examples that work for 2D structure drawings.\n\nIf you actually want 3D geometries, or to figure out whether a hydrogen bond actually exists between 2 atoms, , then things get more complicated.",Chemistry

"There's a couple of reasons, first the common cold isn't a single virus, it's not even a single family of viruses so having immunity to one causal virus just reduces the number of common cold causing viruses that can infect you.  Another is that not all viruses are remembered equally.  Corona viruses in particular is one the body had poor memory for and your immunity will generally wane within 6 to 9 months of infection, just in time to pick it up again the next winter.  This is why those in high risk categories are getting booster shots for Covid 19 to boost that waning immunity.  Third is mutation, this is seen with the influenza virus most notably, hence the yearly flu vaccine where educated guesses are made to try and predict how it will mutate and then produce new vaccines on that prediction.  Fourth would be you're immune system is compromised, perhaps you were recovering from a severe illness or on immuno-suppressant or had viral infection, like measles, which wipes out your immune memory.",Biology

Now, the further Electromagnetic waves travel, the higher the redshift is measured with an ""infinite redshift"" at the event horizon of our observable universe. \n\nDoes that mean the wavelength of those photons approach 0 and wouldn't that also mean, that energy density decreases with time and distance , leading to the curvature of spacetime to ""flatten"", but since energy is always conserved, wouldn't that also mean that space seemingly increases?

Draw 5 boxes (to represent the 5 d orbitals, assuming all are equivalent energy), put one up arrow (one electron in each one, that's one of the rules above mentioned) you have one electron left, so it has to pair up in one of those orbitals.\n\nSo for subsequent oxidation states, can you think of any sensible oxidations to have a nice number of electrons filling those orbitals?\n\nA +3 OS would have 3d5 electrons, ie, one in each orbital.\n\nThis is why +3 is common for Fe.\n\nIt's not a perfect rule, but it will do for your understanding.\n\nhttps://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_and_Websites_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Descriptive_Chemistry/Elements_Organized_by_Block/3_d-Block_Elements/1b_Properties_of_Transition_Metals/Oxidation_States_of_Transition_Metals\n\nNow you could just memorise that almost all transition metals are going to be +2 and +3 (except Cu, which you can work out from assessing it's Valence electrons).\n\nAnother alternative: understand the underlying chemistry and work out the oxidation state.\n\nIt's a lot easier to memorise the anion oxidation state (eg O is almost always 2-, halogens 1-, etc. The common anions as well are easy to remember.

You can't eliminate that. Sharing data is more a measure of truthful behavior in a social, behavioral sense.\n\nI already distinguished that in some cases like observational sciences it can allow some additional science when it is taken generally without respect to the model being tested. That is the case in LIGO: you assume they are capturing actual strain in space-time, and sharing the data is then useful because it wasn't collected with any particular model of neutron stars or even general relativity. So if you have a competing model for such objects, you can use that data to figure out an alternative idea for what produced it.\n\nBut in a case like Dias, the data, even if truly collected from the apparatus, can't generally tell you, for example, whether the compound in the apparatus was prepared as the manuscript says, or whether the temperature and external fields were as the manuscript says.

"It’s hard to say because it depends on what type of plastic the bags were made of. Other ingredients include various kinds of alcohols - methanol, ethanol, propanol - we encounter these in everyday life. They all have noticeable odours; but in low concentration the vapour isn’t something to worry about. Ethanol is the alcohol we find in wine, beer and spirits, the other alcohols are not something you should drink. Propanol is in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer. Methanol is used in fuel - but methanol is poisonous. You can find it in ‘moonshine’, that home made illicit booze. Drinking it is very risky (blindness, even death). But a faint smell of methanol is not really something to worry about. If you look at page 10 of that safety data sheet, it shows the toxic limits, but it takes some interpretation. Napthalene is toxic at 250ppm (parts per million, less than the other ingredients) but napthalene is what they make mothballs out of, and people happily put them in clothes closets for decades. It’s not very volatile, but you can definitely smell it. If you’ve thrown it all away, that’s OK. If you have clothing that’s come into contact with it, or you can smell it on that clothing, just wash that clothing. Some of the chemicals in the list are the same as those you smell in over-ripe fruit like bananas. Amyl acetate is used to make flavourings and scents. Most of these compounds won’t hurt you unless you breathe the vapours in high concentrations for long periods. Speaking for myself (and having worked in labs where we used chemicals like this) I wouldn’t be worried. Just ventilate - closet door wide open, window open - wash clothing that you detect a smell on and you should be OK.",Biology

"Life requires whatever minimum amount of atoms, configured in a certain shape, can use other molecules to reproduce itself/ build itself. Scientist do not yet know what the smallest amount of specifically shaped atoms ( complex molecule or molecules) are able to self-replicate. Many scientists believe that the premordial type of molecule was likely RNA.. very similar to DNA. The theory is called The RNA World Hypothesis. It was developed by the scientific mentors of Jennifer Doudna who recently won the Nobel Prize for CRISPR gene editing. She created a feasibly self replicating RNA consisting of a few thousand atoms, but it's unlikely this was or is the smallest amount of atoms that can self replicate. In short, still unknown.",Biology
"Regarding your question about concentration:\n\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here ([https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844)). It's easiest to understand ""the concentration of water in water"" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\n\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a ""concentration"" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\n\n    A            |           B\n     x  x x  x   |            \n      x x x x x  |        x   \n    x  xx  xx x  |\n\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\n\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate.",Biology
"> spirit of this sub,\n\nClassifications in Biology range from the extremely specific to the incredibly vague. For example, it could identify a young male Blue Tit as, well, that, *or* simply a member of the animal kingdom. Each name and group is derived from the group before it and could not exist without a predecessor.\n\nTherefore, if we do *not* have vague classifactions of nature, we have ignored what our specific names were built off of, we have disrespected the history and hard work of many a biologist before us.\n\nAs such, since many other subs have the specifics down on naming things better than us already, it should be up to us to give vague classifications for the very sake of biology. As long as we remain technically correct, we will have likely fulfilled this goal.\n\nSo it could be said (after jumping through many mental hoops) that it is in the spirit of this sub to be vague about this as long as the other ID subs exist.\n\nNot that anyone much cares, it seems.",Biology

"So it's a laymen's term and my apologies,  but I try not to get too far into minute details on reddit threads out of fear it won't be fully understood by everyone reading it.\n\nWhen vaccinated, your immune system is ""boosted"" - hence the term ""boost"" or ""booster"" for the vaccine. You get a ""surge"", rapid increase, peak, whatever you want to call it to have it make sense to you (as a virologist, immunologist, entomologist, a new worried father, what have you), shortly after your immune system is stimulated. You would therefore after a vaccination ""booster"" get a ""surge"" or sudden increase in circulating antibodies. In this case for a booster it would be IgG antibodies over IgM, or even in this specific case of a pregnant/post-partum/breast-feeding mother IgA antibodies as it's present in her bodily fluids, but I digress.\n\nThen after a period of time the antibodies go down to almost undetectable levels. There's vast variations in the populations and within individuals, so saying that they go to ""0"" is not entirely accurate. In this day and age with there being no herd immunity, vaccine hesitation and resistance, etc., it's quite possible any particular person may have some level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies circulating at any point in time. That's why there's ""baseline"" with testing depending on the type of test done and what has been used as a control to establish that test. I've worked in a variety of laboratories and for instance, there's one influenza variant, let's call it variant A, that if your antibody titer is 1:8 or higher, you are considered immune to that virus (1 portion of your serum had enough antibodies present to bind to virus when mixed with blood and diluted at a ratio of 1:8). But let's also say there's another influenza variant, called B, that's a bit more funky, so we consider a titer of 1:16 or 1:32 protective. Or better yet, it's an H5-based influenza virus, in which case it's highly debated if HAI testing is even a good determinant of protective antibody response at all.

"It really depends on the laws of your country. In a couple of countries (the Netherlands, Portugal, Czech republic, Switzerland) is not illegal to consume any kind of methamphetamine for personal use, regardless on the reason why you are using it. But usually at least some methylamphetamines are categorized as controlled substances and altough consumption might not be per se illegal, possession and sale surely are. There are also several methamphetamines which are perfectly legal in almost all countries and which you can buy in any pharmacy as OTC pharmaceuticals; e.g. levo-methamphetamine and d-pseudoephedrine, but those ones are not really psychoactive so you are not going to get any of the desired effects by smoking them. And returning to your ""science project"", as others have said, only participants can take the drug, not the ones testing its effects. If you want to volunteer as a subject in any clinical trial involving a particular methamphetamine you can surely apply and if you're lucky you are gonna get to use the drug, but I still find unlikely that they will let you smoke crystals of methamphetamine hydrochloride, as other routes of administration are far more likely (for example orally or intravenously). In every case, whatever you do, just be responsible and apply every harm reduction strategy you can. Methamphetamine, just like any other pharmaceutical, is not a joke and you should be extremely careful while handling it if you don't desire to seriously harm yourself.",Biology

I wasn't quite sure how much you might of forgotten so I just brain dumped my thought process. I might check this calculation on paper to see if I've forgotten any steps  or made a mistake.\n\n\n\nEdit:\n\nAfter actually checking the molar ratio of the Ostwald process it appears that I overcomplicated it.\n\nAs the Ostwald process is 1:1 (ammonia:nitric acid) the whole process takes 2 ammonia for 1 ammonium nitrate.\n\nSo you can calculate the mass of the product by just getting the moles of ammonia dividing by 2 and then multiplying by the molar mass of ammonium nitrate.",Chemistry

Boron copper or barium,Chemistry
"I worked on this experiment. AMA\n\nBoron-10 has a high capture cross section for neutrons, and the cross section increases as 1/v. The neutrons in this experiment are ""ultacold neutrons"" (E < a few hundred neV) so 10B has a very high capture cross section. The capture reaction is 10B (n,alpha) 7Li.\n\nThe detector is built like a sandwich. On the outer edges are ~20 nm of 10B. The interior layer is ZnS, a scintillator. In the middle there is acrylic that has wavelength-shifting fibers (WLSF) built into it. From left to right, the structure is 10B : ZnS : acrylic and WLSF : ZnS : 10B.\n\nWhen a neutron captures on 10B either an alpha or a 7Li passes through the ZnS, and the scintillation light is gathered into the WLSF. The WLSF carry the light to the PMTs, and from there the signal can be digitized. One key feature of this detector is that the WLSF are laid out in alternating fashion, so adjacent WLSF transmit light to different PMTs. This allows for us to look for coincident signals between two PMTs, which significantly suppresses (and more importantly, stabilizes!) background noise from ~250 Hz to ~0.5 Hz.\n\nEDIT: grammar",Physics

"Okay so this is a tough question, let me try to bring some light to it.\nSo, the issue here lies with the interpretation on Quantum Mechanics. QM postulates describe how do systems work. They are true (as far as we know), but they don't give a further explanation as to why is the world like this. These postulates describe how measurements are performed by an observer on a quantum system. The measurement collapses the wave function at the moment of the measurement. And the instants before and after the measurement, the system can go back to its usual probabilistic behaviour. However, what does it mean to perform a measurement? The measurement gives a concrete value to a magnitude (it could be energy, speed, position... of the system). Usually, we consider collisions between particles or semiparticles to be measurements, since, in the limit, they are two different systems that interact and preserve the energy and momentum equations(if they are coupled we cannot apply it but for the sake of our argument we'll toss it under the carpet). So, in these cases, even if there's no evident observer, there is indeed a measurement performed in the systems. \nThis means that you don't need to have intelligent observer to collapse a wavefunction.\n\nHowever, if we say the whole universe is a closed system that has a huuuuuge wave function, one could argue that there are only partial observations but the whole universe wavefunction isn't collapsed. Then, you could say that everything is in a quantum state and is in fact governed by qm laws as a wave. What happens with all the other possible discarded states (universes in this case) is a bigger question that has no answer and that messes with the interpretations of qm.\n\nTL;DR: we don't need intelligent observers to collapse wave functions, the universe is and will be a quantum state\n\nHope it was useful:)",Physics

That means for every 100 g of the compound, 0.1 g is contamination of things that aren't the compound I bought. \n\nPurity can relate to concentration, as your actual concentration will be slightly lower than your calculated concentration when preparing solutions.

"So far people commenting are forgetting about *length contraction*: If I'm moving at relativistic speeds, in my reference frame the distance between where I start and where I end up shrinks. Time is still passing for me, but the distance I travel approaches zero as I get closer to the speed of light. At the speed of light, then, the distance *is* zero. Better, points at lightlike separation are a distance zero from each other in the Minkowski metric.\n\nThe implication that confuses the OP, then, is that this means that, in the reference frame of a photon, it exists for only an instant: It is instantaneously transmitted from its origin to its destination, and thus in its frame *no time passes*. In our frame of course it takes time for the light to move, because light doesn't move infinitely fast and the distance between its origin and its destination *isn't* zero. In the photon's frame that distance *is* zero. This is indeed strange, for it says that a photon ""sees"" the universe as flat, with all distances parallel to its direction of travel shrunk to zero; and as far as the photon is concerned it seems not to exist for any time at all.\n\nTo that all I can say is that photons aren't people; they seem to get along with their weird lives with little worry. I don't exactly want to make the excuse that I'm a physicist and not a philosopher, since understanding the ontology is important for the physics, but it is true that special relativity works.

"First, the argument that they make is not the same as the argument you made (even if their conclusion is similar). They make no mention of the source of the CO2 emissions. They only refer to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. At least they understand that what put the CO2 in the atmosphere doesn’t matter. Hopefully you finally agree with this after sharing this link?\n\nSecond, while their conclusion is that the theoretical limit costs more energy to capture carbon than was gained when it was emitted, this directly contradicts the claim made in one of the papers I sent above. That paper claimed that it is theoretically possible (based on thermodynamics) to use a fossil fuel energy source to capture carbon and still have net negative emissions. I’m more inclined to trust the analysis coming from people who specialize in the thermodynamics of gas separations and also who published it on a peer review journal than a post on someone’s substack, even if that person has a PhD in physics. It is possible, however, that the analysis from the 2005 paper represents a theoretical limit that cannot be reached. “Economic and energetic analysis of capturing CO2 from ambient air” (which is cited in the blog post you sent) estimates that with a 5% second law efficiency (they note that real world processes typically have a 5-40% efficiency), the energy costs associated with capturing CO2 from the air is similar to the energy gained from natural gas. If a carbon capture technology were more efficient (and it is theoretically possible for it to be more efficient based on arguments in this same paper), then it would be feasible to power direct air capture with a natural gas plant and still have negative emissions, and if it were powered with renewables then it would be even better in terms of the CO2 reduction. \n\nUltimately, it is true that carbon capture is an energy intensive process. It is not, however, true that the relevant quantity to consider in evaluating the thermodynamics of carbon capture is the energy gained from the initial CO2 emissions. It just so happens that the actual thermodynamic process that is relevant (that of the adsorption and desorption of CO2, which is what I’ve been saying all along) happens to give you a similar amount of energy required for capture as natural gas generates for the same amount of CO2 emitted if you assume that the process has a second law efficiency of 5%. There’s nothing saying the second law efficiency can’t be better than 5%, and also it doesn’t matter that a lot of historic emissions have been from sources besides natural gas (like coal) which emit more CO2 per unit of energy generated. In the argument you were making where the source mattered, these coal emissions would be relevant in addition to other sources. This might seem like a small point, but the main thing we have been discussing is what is the theoretical limit of CO2 capture and what is the relevant thermodynamic process to consider for it, and you were mistaken in thinking the initial emission process was relevant. Perhaps you think that the 5% second law efficiency won’t be bested, in which case the energy use for direct air capture would probably be prohibitive; this is a reasonable thing to believe, and it seems like there are people who are knowledgeable about gas separations who believe it, but it is very different from claiming that direct air capture could never be feasible because the thermodynamics of it could never be favorable. The fact that it could be feasible is why it is a very active topic of research.\n\nEdit: I was looking back through the DAC review article that I initially sent, and wanted to conclude with adding this quotation “Lackner thus concluded that the potential for greater efficiencies with DAC closes the gap in energy requirements between the two processes and suggests that arguments of DAC being unfeasible due to large energy demands compared to flue gas capture may not be accurate.” In the paragraphs following this quotation, the review article discusses different argument made by different papers regarding the energy required in an actual material. They are not all on agreement, and the process is complicated enough that the various approaches from each paper often have drawbacks that could limit the accuracy of their estimates. Clearly, there is debate about the energy requirements of DAC. Some scientists/experts think it the technology won’t be able to get efficient enough, while others think that it can. I don’t think any of the experts think that it is thermodynamically impossible though, just that some think efficiencies might not be able to get close enough to the thermodynamic limit to make DAC reasonably cheap. Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.",Physics

"In quantum field theory (which we know to work pretty damn well), in principle there are certain processes that are allowed to happen. Those processes are called ""Charge-Parity symmetry violating"". There's one parameter (called Θ) in our equations that determines how frequent those processes should occur, and this is something we have to measure experimentally and cannot derive theoretically, just like the masses of particles, their charges or how strong certain interactions are.\n\nAnd we experimentally find that those processes...have never occured once since we started looking for them in the 70's. So, it's pretty plausible that the parameter Θ is zero. We can't know for sure, though, and it could also be super super tiny.\n\nWell, it turns out that if this parameter Θ isn't just a fixed number, but another quantum mechanical field, then it would automatically cause those processes to never occur. Of course, this is a slightly more complex mechanism (replacing a number with a field), but it would work perfectly - and this is basically what we also did with particle masses. Before we treated them as pure numbers, but then Higgs came up with the idea that those might be caused by a field. And every field comes with a particle attached to it, and as you might have heard, we found that Higgs-particle.\n\nSo, if there is a field for our parameter Θ, then this also comes with another particle, and this is the axion. The existence of this particle would immediatly solve our original problem of possible processes never occuring, it would also be very, very light and have all the properties we need for a dark matter particle. And us cosmologists need dark matter to explain a lot about the universe - there seems to be a lot more mass in the universe than we can find. And we notice this lack of mass in many, many different scenarios.\n\nThe axion could easily solve two of the biggest outstanding problems in physics, the strong CP problem and the dark matter problem.

The bug uses its stout beak to inject the prey insect with a toxin that kills it within 30 seconds. Most of their prey are pest insects so they are considered beneficial to farmers and gardeners. They move slowly and are clumsy fliers.

"My brother is the nuclear engineer so I know more than the average chemist but I'm no expert. I'm still reasonably certain that this is wrong. You don't really input energy into a nuclear reactor. You have fuel rods that will always and constantly give off neutrons. You use neutron moderators, usually coolant as water, to thermalize the neutrons and slow them down. Slower neutrons are more likely to collide with uranium for more reactions. Then you use reflectors and absorbers like beryllium and boron, respectively, to control how many neutrons there are around the fuel rods. At no point did I have to input any energy to cause the uranium to decay and give off neutrons. It's just doing what it would do anyways, and I'm controlling it with external factors. \n\nSo from that standpoint, I think the key things for the chemistry of your fuel rods are factors like density of your actual fuel (ie crystal structure), it's propensity to form cracks during it's lifetime, thermal expansion, etc etc. Even if this couterion neutron capture is an issue, I think it would take a back seat to the other factors and be relatively minor. I could 100% be wrong. I think you need to talk to the nuclear engineering reddit to be sure, but that's my understanding.",Chemistry

"A few things. You might have negative- frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype, reflected by genotype, is going to have an advantage in the environment. For instance, if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype, a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food.  So if the light voles are more common, foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles, recognising them as good prey. This would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed. This cycle continues perpetually. \n\nHowever, this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness. \n\nMore likely on a *year to year* basis, the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another. Perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year. If there is no flooding, the dry-type genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population, however, in flooded years the wet-liking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes.",Biology

My body was still travel in a straight line due to inertia. From the bike’s perspective my body’s center of gravity would no longer be centered on the seat and tires and would start to cause a torque which tilts the bicycle right.

"Part answer to your question: there's so much chemistry we don't know of the first 92 elements. Elements which are actually pretty stable, can be made and quantified and studied far more easily.\n\nThe biggest issue with heavy elements is radioactivity and rarity. Rarity makes them expensive. Radioactivity makes them difficult to use from a chemistry perspective. If you make an Es complex, it will only stay an Es complex for as long as the isotope exists. When that's on the order of seconds, microseconds etc, it's basically impossible to isolate it as a compound.\n\nIf you cannot isolate it as a compound, it's difficult to study.\n\nAnd there's the more practical reason, if you cannot isolate it, can you really call it a ""useful"" product.\n\nThinking of the economics of chemistry, what industrial process wants to use a very rare, very expensive element that decays over a matter of seconds in their chemical process.\n\nSo the applications aren't there, so the funding isn't there, so chemists don't study it.\n\nPhysicists on the other hand love heavy elements, because they care about fundamental processes.

"Hello, I'm kinda stressing out about choosing to major in chemistry or some biological science.  \nA little background:  \nI am currently a sophomore in college. I entered as a computer science major. I have done really well so far, currently having a 3.97 GPA. Over this past year, my Grandfather entered hospice care. I have been taking care of him at night and in the mornings. I help him go to the bathroom and make sure he is clean. I give him baths and help administer medicine. I guess I'm trying to say I enjoy taking care of him. I feel drawn to the healthcare field now and I no longer really love computer science. I used to code for fun(make apps/build websites) but haven't felt the urge or desire to attempt any new projects. Looking out 5/10 years from now I don't really see myself being happy with software development even if there is a lot of money to be made. I think I want to become a doctor. I have always had a heart for taking care of people and I think becoming a doctor would be incredibly rewarding.  \nAnyways, I decided to take gen chem and biology as electives alongside my CS courses this semester to see if I could major in one of them. I am doing well in both of them right now with A's. I enjoy both courses but was wondering which one would be a better fit for me. Biology seems to involve a lot more memorization but also looks at how larger systems work. This is somewhat similar to CS problem solving in that it breaks complex systems into smaller ones that are more easily manageable. My chem course has more problem solving and math. I'm not the biggest fan of memorizing info even though I am pretty good at it. I enjoy math and breaking a problem down into more logical steps. I would rather work on 20 calculus problems for a couple of hours than review notecards for a couple of hours. I was wondering at the higher levels which major would suit my learning style better.  \n   \nIf anyone could help me out I would appreciate It. I apologize for any grammar/writing errors. I have never been too good at writing. Thanks again.",Chemistry

You cannot drop an inverted bullet, but you can pick it up as it undoes being dropped at a later point in your timeline.\n\nBut then indeed, it should also mean that you cannot see uninverted light while you are inverted, but how would it work if say, the sun shines on an inverted object, how does non-inverted light reflect off of inverted surfaces? From the object's point of view, something happened that caused him to emit sunlight back at the sun, meaning you can calculate what light it must have shone onto it that caused it to emit sunlight (sunlight + what it should absorb).

He did not invent the entirety of what we have today - there are a ton of pieces to it building on more than just his work.\n\nYes, he does have that opinion.  Other scientists, and many more of them, have other opinions.  Those opinions involve large-scale research and published clinical trials with this vaccine technology.  Has Malone demonstrated a higher clinical incidence of vaccine adverse effects than anyone else?  Has he shown that hospitals are overflowing with people having negative vaccine reactions and dying from them?  If he’s shown this in a rigorous way as others have done for their claims, as opposed to just stating theories, he should publish it, and he’ll be easily searchable.\n\nWhatever Malone’s position, it’s abundantly clear that, unlike OP stated, Dr. Malone has not “proven” that infection-induced immunity is better than vaccine-induced immunity.  If you have a **peer-reviewed paper published** by Malone in a scientific journal “proving” that, as OP claimed, you are welcome to share it.",Biology
"This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\n\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don’t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \n\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\n\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\n\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried “salt bridges” where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\n\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to “bend” the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\n\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \n\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\n\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\n\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \n\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains “zip up” very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that’s going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\n\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I’ve outlined above. \n\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\n\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher’s hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities.",Biology

"OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.",Biology

Welcome to the world of health anxiety,Biology
"Here’s a lengthy quote where you rejected that claim I made above. \n\n““>The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn’t affect the energy required to capture it at all. [I said this, and you rejected this claim in the following]\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.  \n\n... \n\nregardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back. “\n\n[End of your quote. If you don’t feel like reading all of this, I would encourage you to just think about what I say at the very end of this comment regarding the way you seem to think you understand the thermodynamics of the situation better than published experts in this field whose views I have explicitly cited in my argument] \n\nIn the above, you pretty clearly said that you thought that the amount of the energy gained was relevant in determining the thermodynamic feasibility. It is not. You now seem to be claiming that instead you were just hoping to estimate the amount of energy that would be required to capture the carbon, but it is also not useful as an estimate of how much energy would be required (even if it just so happens to be close if you assume all of the emissions were via natural gas, but there’s no reason to assume all emissions are from natural gas). The blog post that you sent does not care at all about the source. All that I’ve been trying to argue is that the energy gained from the CO2 source does not matter. It seems like maybe you now agree with this claim, or perhaps you agreed with it all along. \n\nTo assess the thermodynamic feasibility of carbon capture, you have to have to carry out a pretty involved modeling of the capture process. Any such model will make assumptions which other experts may or may not agree with, which is why there are a range of estimates for the energy cost. It is made especially difficult to estimate because we don’t actually know what the efficiency of future technology will be, so any estimate that relies on taking some thermodynamic limiting case and then estimating the energy expenditure of a real life material by guessing some efficiency as a percentage of the thermodynamic limiting case will be highly dependent on what someone guesses for the efficiency. As I mentioned above, the direct air capture article that I referred you to mentions how a typical efficiency range can be from 5-40%. Depending on how efficient researchers are able to make a material, it could end up being energetically worthwhile. There is no thermodynamically determined limit that guarantees carbon capture will use too much energy to make it worthwhile. Again, I wonder why you are so insistent that I am wrong about this? At this point I’ve summarized several journal articles about carbon capture, and they agree with what I’m saying. That carbon capture review article is what gave me the impression you were incorrect in the first place (I read it a long time ago). It’s one thing for you to say that me, a random redditor whose background you know nothing about is wrong, but why is it that you’re so sure you understand carbon capture better than experts in the field that I’ve cited?\n\nEdit: \nAlso, when you said this it confused me:\n“>your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got.\n\nShow me where I've said that DAC is impossible, instead of unfeasible, or -- pretty please -- shut up.  Intentional misrepresentation is *not* civil.”\n\nIn the post where you quoted me I said “[you] claim that ... DAC ... couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got” and then you tell me to “shut up” for saying that you said that “DAC is imposible instead of unfeasible.” I’m very confused by what caused your aggressive response. As far as I can tell, I’m this part where you quoted me I’m saying that you claimed DAC was unfeasible? If you think that when I said “couldn’t be feasible” this was meant to be synonymous with “impossible” rather than “unfeasible,” then either you’ve misread what I wrote or I wrote it poorly. In either case, I was not trying to intentionally misrepresent what you said. I apologize if it came off like that, and I’m also sort of surprised by your hostile tone here.\n\nTo clarify what I meant by ""Hopefully we can both agree on this point, which is different from your initial claim that thermodynamics limits DAC to a point where it couldn’t be feasible no matter how efficient it got,"" what I was trying to say is that my impression of what you have been saying is something like ""thermodynamics limits the energy efficiency of carbon capture in a way that no matter how efficient carbon capture technology got, it would not be energetically feasible because the minimum energy required to capture carbon would be too high to make it worthwhile."" It's clear that it is possible for people to capture CO2 from the air since there are already plants that do this, what I meant regarding the possibility or feasibility of it had to do with whether or not the energy cost would render direct air capture a practical way to reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. I think that practical is likely a better word than ""possible"" or ""feasible"" or whatever else, and I probably expressed what I was saying in an unclear way, but I hope from context it was clear what I meant.\n\nPerhaps what I wrote expressed the sentiment that I was trying to convey poorly; you were rather ungenerous to me in assuming that I was trying to put words in your mouth as a rhetorical trick to ""win"" the argument. In any discussion like this, it is obviously important for both people to understand what the other person is saying, and sometimes people misunderstand each other. If you think that I misrepresented what you were saying, I apologize again and I assure you that I wasn't doing so intentionally. Additionally, it is a little bit ironic that I now feel that you've misrepresented me when you said that I intentionally misrepresented you.",Physics

"It's called a force because in a rotating reference frame it can cause an acceleration relative to that frame.\n\nIn non-inertial reference frames, Newton's Laws cannot all hold at the same time. You could either throw out Newton's second law, in which case accelerations arise out of ""nowhere"", or you can throw out Newton's third law, in which case you can have forces that do not arise from any sort of interaction. People tend to opt for the latter, and so such forces are called ""fictitious"" or ""pseudo forces"". But within those non-inertial frames those forces are indeed ""real"", since they follow Newton's second law just like any other ""real"" force.\n\nThe issue with the misunderstanding is that people don't really stop to think what they mean by ""real"".",Physics

So if you have a lot of airflow, that will increase the rate of stabilizing the temperature (outside and inside being the same temperature). The only way that curtains will help is by blocking airflow to the window where conduction or diffusion (air escaping through tiny gaps) will happen.  But you could achieve a similar effect with something transparent (shower curtains honestly would be more than enough and prevent a decent amount of conduction).\n\nThe sun's radiated heat can be a huge factor in warming an area.

If that is happening combining two streams gets you the same max temperature. But since some heat would immediately lost to surrounding air, having two flames in the area seems like it would mean less surrounding air to transfer heat to.\n\nWould it double the temperature, no. Increase, probably.\n\nNow if you could safely preheat the gasses in the second burner with the first, then it seems you could almost double the temperature.

We're limited with how far we can go there because the half lives start getting too short for neutron capture to occur before the target decomposes. There ultimately isn't enough incentive to design a whole new reactor to slightly increase the yields of heavier isotopes of these elements because we still most likely won't be able to push further past Fm.\n\nMost of our current synthetic chemistry starts to not work very effectively on a µg scale which is why the state of the art is pretty much limited to Bk/Cf since Es and Fm are only available on sub-µg scales.

"I'll attempt to answer your question in the most straight forward and simplistic way I can.  I'll avoid getting too detailed so you can wrap your mind around the basic concept of viruses. \n\n----------------------------------\n\nViruses don't ""want"" anything or have goals, motives, desires or intent. Viruses exist to only to replicate. \n\nViruses are completely reliant on a host to do the replication for them. \n\nVirulence is a human created term to categorize the severity of illness caused by a viral infection. \n\nSome viruses cause little, if any, ill effect on the host.\n\nSome viruses cause the host to fall ill for prolonged periods of time. \n\nSome viruses can infect a host for the duration of the host's life. \n\nSome viruses can cause severe acute illness followed by death. \n\nSome viruses infect a host just once but leave the host forever scarred or with significant long-term health issues \n\nMany viruses are host specific, meaning they can only infect a certain specie(s).  \n\nViruses infect very specific cellular systems within the host specie(s).  \n\nThoes infected cells are ""hijacked"" by the viral genetic information and given instruction to replicate the virus over and over and over again until the infected cell bursts with millions of copies of the virus.  \n\nThe replicated viral copies quickly infect the adjoining cells and the process repeats until either all the cells are destroyed or the immune system of the host gets the viral invasion under control. \n\nMutations during the replication process drive the evolution and success of viruses. \n\nThe more the virus is able to replicate, the higher the probability of a mutation occurring. \n\nMutation are caused by errors made in the replication process.  Nearly all mutations are unsuccessful dead-ends for the virus. \n\nSome chance random mutations may make the virus more successful. \n\nA ""beneficial"" mutation may give a virus ability to replicate at a greater rate, in greater numbers, infect different cellular systems or even infect other species.\n\nWhen a virus mutates to infect a new  specie(s), it becomes a novel virus for the new host(s). \n\nA novel virus can be highly virulent on a new host because the new host has no immunity to combat the virus. \n\nA novel virus can replicate unchecked within the new host specie because there is no ""programed"" immune response to combat the novel viral infection.  \n\nWhen a virus is given the opportunity to replicate unimpeded, the probability of a successful mutations increases. \n\nAs the virus mutates through host replication, it may become more virulent on the host. \n\nIf a virus is overly virulent on its host, it often leads to an evolutionary dead end - in other words, if all the hosts are killed by a virus, the virus won't be able to replicate and will go extinct.\n\nOver time, natural selection tends to favor the mutations that make virus more transmissible over mutations that make it more virulent. \n\nThe most successful viruses are ones that have evolved to be highly transmissible but have minimal virulent effects on the host. \n\nSome viruses can be highly virulent on certain individuals in the host population and have no virulent impact on other individuals within the same population. \n\nOver time, the genetic traits in thoes unaffected individuals will be passed along to subsequent generations and become the dominant trait within the host population.  \n\nThis relationship between viruses and their hosts has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years. It's known as an evolutionary ""arms race"". \n\nViruses have always, and will continue to always be one of the selection factors driving the evolution and diversity of species on our planet.  \n\n----------------------------------\n\nAgain, I tried to make the information very simple and loose.

"Yup, I think this might be the best observation. There are some megataxonomies of viruses that emerged prior to LUCA, and their genomes also work with the standard twenty amino acids. So, while observing that both archaea and bacteria use all twenty may show that at least LUCA used these twenty amino acids, that all viruses also use them suggests a far more primitive, probably pre-cellular adoption to the twenty amino acids.\n\nSomeone could argue that it's possible that all megataxonomies of viruses only adopted the standard twenty after LUCA and only later evolved towards the current system as a result of evolution. So, while it seems quite implausible, the argument may go that it is at least *possible* this doesn't prove viruses indicate an earlier origins of the twenty amino acids than LUCA. But it turns out that LUCAs own genome is filled with viruses that used the standard twenty amino acids. So LUCAs own virome helps confirm an earlier origins of the twenty.

Gluconeogenesis only occurs when you are low on fuel. (Hungry)\n\nIf hungry —> glucose is broken down for energy\n\nIf not hungry —> glucose is converted to fuel-storage molecules.\n\n\nEXPLANATION: \n\nWhen you eat a meal but are not starving, your body is not short of energy, so the food you eat won’t be broken down to produce energy as it would basically be wasted (it’s more complicated but is sufficient to explain my point). Instead, the body converts the glucose into fuel-storage molecules such as glycogen and fat to give the body an emergency fuel source.\n\nHowever, when you are starving, your body is low on glucose. The body needs to maintain a steady glucose concentration for survival, so it produces glucose by gluconeogenesis. This glucose has a different function than the glucose we ingest because in this case, we are starving and need fuel to survive. So instead, the glucose is broken down to produce energy for the body.",Biology

"As others have mentioned, the physical differences in scale often directly lead to differences in chemical properties. In general, as your volume goes up, the surface area/volume ratio of your container decreases, so there will be changes in any area-dependent processes (like heat exchange). Some processes that are fairly straightforward on the bench like filtration or evaporation can become much bigger headaches when scaled up. Something as simple as mixing might take hours instead of minutes- and if you have always mixed a solution for 10 minutes on the benchtop, you might get the nasty surprise that it isn't stable if you mix it for 3 hours.\n\nScale-up often also affects your equipment and the materials involved. You might mix something on the bench in a glass flask with a PTFE stirbar on a hotplate. In the plant, it might be done in a hot water jacketed stainless steel tank with an overhead blade mixer. All of the changes you make to scale up- more powerful mixers, bigger pumps, larger diameter pipes and hoses, can introduce unexpected effects into your system beyond just bigger scale. A big challenge with scaling up pharmaceuticals for instance is that any new material you introduce into the method that has the opportunity for product contact, particularly soft materials like hoses and gaskets, has the potential to leach into your product, or catalyze degradation, or otherwise do something bad that you never saw in the lab.",Chemistry

"It is just a formal notation. NO3^(-)-N means somehting like ""nitrogens in nitrate"". \n\nExample: you are testing a 10 L soil sample for nitrate. You get 1 mole of nitrate es result. The mass number of nitrate is 62 u, the mass number of nitrogen is 14 u. If you are now calculation the mass concentration you would get \n\n- c(NO3^(-)) = N*62u per 10 L\n- or c(NO3^(-)N) = N*14u per 10 L\n\nnote: N is the dimensionless avogadro number\n\nSo in easy words: it's nitrate just calculated like nitrogen. This is often used in enviormental chemistry, food chemistry and other related fields, because upper limits are often defined via a max nitrogen equivalent. This has the advantage, that you dont need strict limits for e.g. nitrate and nitrit (because both may vary a bit but still be good or bad) but you can regulated via using limits for easily detectable species.",Chemistry

"Hmm.  I would submit that many if not most highly-successful models in physics are or at least started out as exactly that:  hacks, as you've defined them here.  Models like old quantum theory, the Bohr model of the atom, and even the standard model of particle physics today — these models are (or started out as) a cobbling-together of disparate or otherwise questionable techniques (ex. perturbation theory, quantization, renormalization, etc.), some of which still don't have terribly satisfactory explanations today.  Yet, they were or still are ""unreasonably"" successful at ... well, modelling natural physics — or to put it another way, at making accurate predictions.\n\nIt seems to me that people — humans in general, and physicists/scientists by extension — are a bit too biased towards wanting elegance in models, or in the philosophy of science concerning those models.  While there are certainly some historical examples of ""deeper"" discovered theories or underlying mathematical framework being more elegant or simple or (for example as with gauge unification), there are arguably many more historical examples of deeper underlying theories/frameworks simply being more complicated and/or less elegant (ex. quantum mechanics compared to classical mechanics in general).\n\nTo borrow someone else's words (not sure who anymore), I think it's important not to confuse the quest for truth with a quest for beauty ... too often we want all of nature's loose ends to all be tied up neatly, but nature is under no obligation to be tame or elegant at all.  It's nice that we find it to be in some situations, but that doesn't mean we should expect nature to not have its own warts, too.  And it seems to me that idea extends to natural law as much as it extends to the ""content"" of nature (matter, and how the world/cosmos is arranged, etc.).\n\nThoughts?  Cheers,",Physics

But there is zero reason to speculate on a completely different ""mechanism"" for gravity based on pure guessing, thats just not how science works.\n\nOne remark on your idea, trying to relate gravity to magnetism just makes no sense. Even before Einstein, gravity in Newtonian physics and magnetism are just way to different: The gravitational field has monopoles, the magnetic field cannot have monopoles, only at least dipoles (every magnetic source ever has a north and a south pole, while there is only one gravitational charge aka mass). A gravitational field applies work on a test charge, a magnetic field doesn't. There are many other similar discrepancies, and these are only the most basic ones that everyone learns in their first year at university.\n\nAs a remark, I realize that all this may come of as a bit condescending, and it is good that you are interested in this stuff and try to think it through yourself. But the truth is, you won't solve any problems or even get the right ideas by guessing based on half-truths and half-knowledge.

"Disclaimer: You are taking the very first steps of a very long road thrilled by many physicists, many of them never accepted Quantum Mecanics as a physical theory.\n\nYour thought experiment were in fact already executed several times and in different situations. There are a lot of underlying conditions you may be missing, I will give you some food for thought:\n1) Under Quantum Mechanics formalism (QM), energy conservation is not to be understood in the same way you may have under Classical Mechanics. The most striking example of this is the tunneling of particles through a potential greater than its total mechanical energy. But this is not the only one. See the Casimir force, for example;\n2) In your setup, you are probably taking your 'detectors' as perfect ones, which never miss any detection and does not give false positive. Even in a thought experiment, it is hard to conciliate this with QM formalism. Either way, supposing you have one, you are entering the 'spooky action at distance'. See the debate between Einstein and Bohr on this subject, where Einstein states what was later known as EPR paradox. I consider this a very important criticism because - although Einstein were proved wrong at the end, its questioning gave rise to a whole new field of QM, known as the QM contextuality. The first concise steps in this new field were given by Bell, which stated his famous 'inequality', I suggest you to have a try on this too;\n3) The true answer to your question is: the speed at which this 'information of detection' should travel is not relevant. What is known is that it happens as long as you adquire information about the system, you have your 'colapse'. Also, it does not violate classical energy conservation, because in the long run, i.e., in the limit where you have a long enough number of trials, total energy will be conserved. If you search for the arguments and references I've mentioned in step 2, you will inevitably end in the so called 'Hidden Variables Theory', which is in fact the begining of the contextuality problem.",Physics

"For me, biology was a lot of memorization in the first 5 classes or so, and chemistry was much more “learn a set of skills” and problem solve with them.\n\nNot sure why some people are telling you chemistry isn’t.  If you genuinely like and are good at chemistry, you memorize a few things and then problem solve the rest.  Look into organic chemistry.  It’s very puzzle-like.  I took like 70 hours of chemistry as an undergrad- it’s far more applied than memorization.\n\nGranted, I’m now transitioning over to computational chemistry after doing an organic chemistry PhD and 4 years of medicinal chemistry in the pharmaceutical industry, so take that with whatever grain of salt you want.\n\nThe one thing I’ll say is that unlike in school, where you’re applying known things to answer questions, chemistry bench research is far slower.  It’s much less obvious what you should be doing and when you go wrong, it’s much less obvious why.  This gets way better as you become better, but the turn around time from asking the question to figuring out it’s not working to figuring out why it’s not working is far slower than in programming.\n\nIn programming, if you can design a solution in your head, there’s almost always a way to do it with enough work.  You also get fast feedback when your code doesn’t work, and even suggestions on where exactly that error is.  This is not true in chemistry research.\n\nHowever, in undergrad, it is if you understand chemistry.  There’s no feedback loop- you just use the rules you learned to approach and solve the problem they give you.\n\nEither way, good luck!",Chemistry

">Hmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off\n\nmRNA is used for translation. It's the very basic central dogma of molecular biology.\n\n>I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body.\n\nEvery step of the way of translation to post translational protein modification can be modulated. I don't think the issue is with excessive expression of the mRNA, honestly. Right from the beginning, i ruled out mRNA because of the weak responses and thought that the more traditional vaccines would be more effective in a pandemic.

My experience is mostly limited to American energy policy, but there's not much reason to believe other countries would have it substantially better when even the French nuclear industry is broadly declining.\n\nDue to the numerous safety regulations governing nuclear power plant construction, upkeep, and decommissioning (which, for the record, I think are a good thing), nuclear power plants are expensive as hell and take forever to build. kWh for kWh, they simply cannot compete economically with cheap silicon PV. Even if they could, a primarily nuclear energy industry would require new power plants being finished across the country every few days just to keep up with the rate at which they'd be decommissioned. Given how long they take to build, it's easy to see that the modern American nuclear industry is literally multiple orders of magnitude away from providing more than ancillary support to a broader green energy economy, powered primarily by solar and wind.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine a universe where investment in nuclear energy deployment continued apace for the past few decades, laying the foundation for a zero-carbon nuclear future.

Sounds stupid, but I have come across a company with a different technology who just thought that they had to improve their tech and put in more energy scavenging to break even.\n\n2. They are only reconstituting carbon, whereas most fossil fuels are hydrocarbon. It could be that they are banking on the extra energy from the hydrogen part of the combustion. Unlikely, because the Carnot limit would probably still leave a power plant operating at a loss. \n\n3.  This is not aimed at power plants, but at things like cement factories which also produce CO2.

"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.",Biology

The only other way is to provide sufficient distance that a smaller force can act for longer to achieve that same goal. \n\n\nWith a punch, the body constrains the distance available and so high acceleration is needed. This is limited by how quickly the muscles can contract. The amount of excess tension in other muscles is also a retarding factor to that acceleration. \n\n\nA punch just using the arm will be quicker, but the more powerful punches need to engage the rest of the body, which again reduces speed.

Radioactive decay produces far more energy than required to break a bond. So even if the ultra heavy element forms a bond, when the atom decays it breaks the bond with the excess energy from the decay.\n\nI'm not by any means saying give up on a dream, but you might need to be realistic about your options here.

"I'll disagree with saying dopamine is ""the cause"" of addiction. Here's my view. Addiction is a lock and key. If you gave Adderall to a large random sample some would hate it, some would not. Some fraction would be more mentally effective but not addicted, and some would become addicted regardless of any pharmacological benefit.\n\nAn example: I was on morphine for about 2 weeks after serious surgery when I was in my early 20s. I was taken off of it fairly suddenly when I went home. I had physical withdrawal but didn't realize it, and called my doctor with ""odd"" symptoms. He literally laughed on the phone but didn't say why, and gave me a prescription for a tranquilizer for a week or two. A few days later a friend explained it. So, did I crave opiates when I went off, or after I found out what happened? No. Would I have considered it taking it if I could somehow get it free and safely? Not even a little. I have a life to lead, thank you. What about years later when I went through chronic depression and had had personal experience or familiarity with more addictive things? No, never called to me. Does that make me better than an addict? Absolutely not, just lucky in that particular way. \n\nAs a baseline (possibly genetic), most people have very low to moderately low vulnerability to addiction, but more is fairly common. If someone with significant baseline potential is in a situation of chronic pain, either physical or emotional, their vulnerability goes up rapidly in proportion to the pain.\n\nEmotional pain can be things people don't even realize is pain because they've normalized it. Low self esteem, a bad marriage, a sense of failure, a phobia or chronic anxiety, fear about a large scale issue like climate change, or chronic hate (at the government, women, themselves, or whatever).\n\nWhy have addiction rates skyrocketed in the US? You don't have to be anyplace on the political spectrum, and barely awake, to know the problem. Suicide and crime rates skyrocketing. Obesity and diabetes skyrocketing. People hate social media and use it more than ever. Ever larger corporations and no privacy. The country has been gradually tearing itself apart more and more.\n\nThere is one and only one trigger for addiction rates climbing ever since The US Vietnam War and 60's social strife, up through the (current) pandemic and strife. One trigger: increasing chronic, individual pain. Any coincidence that the steepest climb in addictions lately is in pain medication? I think not.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

"I always wondered how that was reconciled along a timeline. Thanks for the explanation. \n\nSpecies concepts are useful for extant organisms (for example in wildlife biology - my field), but these are always loose definitions. Usually we split extant species based on whether two populations are closely related enough to create viable offspring. But this is imperfect because of hybrids, so a combination of concepts is used. For example, lions and tigers can reproduce but they would never meet in nature because their geographic ranges don’t overlap (also this is an imperfect example because ligers have tons of birth defects). Another example would be coyotes and red wolves, but anthropogenic habitat modification has caused overlap and hybridization.",Biology
"If by expired you just mean outlasts its sell-by or use-by date, but is still sealed up inside the bottle or can, then probably not much. If the seal is still good and no air can get in, then there won't be much decomposition in most cases.\n\nThe exceptions will be certain wines or beers which still contain some live yeasts - you can tell which ones these are because there will be some visible sediment at the bottom of the bottle. These also tend to have shorter dates on them, because they can go bad much quicker. The temperature of storage also makes a big difference to these - if kept refrigerated they will probably outlast their dates, if kept in a warm storage room they likely won't. Anyway, the active yeast will be slowly consuming any sugars still present in the drink, the rate depending on temperature. So the drink will eventually end up very dry, sour and probably somewhat over-carbonated - if the bottle hasn't exploded by that time!\n\nFor the other category you mentioned where the drink is exposed to the air, it depends on what the alcohol content starts at. For spirits, they will at first lose alcohol by evaporation, until the percentage by volume drops to a level where bacteria can actually survive in the solution. From that point, bacteria will start to grow, including the type which metabolise alcohol into acetic acid.\n\nFor wines and beers, the bacterial contamination will begin much more quickly (within days) if open to the air. So again, bacteria will start to grow, and the alcohol content will start being converted into acetic acid, forming vinegar. If enough bacteria grow, you can end up with a slimy layer on the top, which is a combination of the bacteria themselves and their other metabolic products, one of which is cellulose, which forms the slime or jelly-like substance, known in the brewing trade as ""mother of vinegar"". The reason it has this name is that you can take a piece of this and add it to any other wine or beer and it will kick-start the vinegar production at an accelerated rate.\n\nIf you want a vinegar acceptable for use as a condiment or in cooking, then you ideally want an acetic acid content somewhere between 3 and 6 %, and a residual alcohol content between 0.5 and 1 %. If the bacterial fermentation is allowed to continue until all the alcohol is consumed, then different bacteria take over which start consuming the acetic acid. They will then carry on doing that until all the acetic acid is gone too, and then you will be left with basically water with a lot of dead bacteria in it. This may subsequently grow mould, but it would be useless long before it got that far.",Chemistry

"Hey I have several questions for a fictional book I’m writing\n\n  \n1.  What would theoretically happen if matter was destroyed? Would the energy that said matter contained (E=mc\^2) be released (assuming energy wasn’t destroyed)? \n\n2. Adding to question 1, is it theoretically  it possible to destroy a black hole? And what might happen if we did? Would all the energy from that compressed matter cause a massive explosion?   \n\n\n3. Say someone were to compress a solar systems worth of distance around themselves, WITHOUT disturbing their surroundings—As in ignoring any factors (like gravity) that may disturb his surroundings. All of this distance is compressed into an inch around themselves. Think of it like an aura covering his body entirely. If your average joe were to throw a punch at him, would his hand slow down because it’s attempting to travel a solar systems worth of distance over the distance of 1 inch? \n\n4. Adding on to the previous question, say joe were to close that distance halfway before the man compressed distance around him. Would Joe’s hand be ripped to shreds because his hand is not being enough to travel that distance? Or would Joe’s hand be ripped off his arm and crushed into a small space? Or would Joe‘s hand be pushed back and slowed down?\n\nThank You to anyone who helps me out!!!",Physics

Then you can plot it on a XY plot, where X is concentration, and Y is response (surface area of a peak at given concentration) - that is your calibration curve.\n\nYou use the curve (or more accurately, the function describing it) to find concentrations of compounds in an analysed sample. \n\nYou're supposed to do this for every compound you're looking for.\n\nBesides of the response, the standard also points out the retention times for each of the compounds you're looking for.",Chemistry

There's not freedom to make up new nonsense. The usage of ""dark sector of invisible particles"" means something specific to physicists. A term like ""dark"" often means ""not interacting with light"" -- e.g. if you're not in the light you're in the dark. It's not dark in the ""black magic"" sense. ""Sector"" often refers to some subset of matter fields and their coupling to some other subset of force carrying fields and the ""group representations"" that describe their relations. A ""dark sector"" here would be described by very familiar mechanisms and math and just would be an addendum onto our normal standard model description. \n\nAn analogy to explain why people are annoyed by your comment would be putting together a puzzle.

"Industrial medicinal chemistry here, not in the US but there'll be some commonalities.\n\nYou'd start doing synthetic organic chemistry while they teach you the med chem, the chemistry is often simpler and less cutting edge than what you're probably doing for your PhD but the priority is getting the compound out for testing as fast as possible. There will be challenging targets or projects which need more effort and synthetic skill, these tend to get tackled as a team but there is the opportunity for individuals to make their mark. People tend to pick up the med chem quite quickly just from being immersed in it, as time goes by you'll learn to design compounds and analyse the assay data. For me, getting the data back on something you designed or made and seeing it progress through the assays is a really fun part of the job.\n\nEquipment and time-saving kit are more readily available. Whereas academia has little funding and lots of student time, industry is time-poor and willing to spend money to make the best use of it. Industry loves new technology and will often invest in it quite heavily. More time is spent on admin and meetings than in academia, and there are far more rules and policies to follow.\n\nSalary is usually pretty good and should be much better than a PhD stipend, most companies have bonuses and stock options too. Careers development again depends on the company but large firms are usually quite good at helping you develop your career the way you want to, such as specialising in synthesis, med chem or people management. Hours will depend on the company culture - some of my US colleagues work quite long days, but on the whole it's likely to be less hours than a PhD.",Chemistry

"I have a question about hypothetical spacecraft trajectories between destinations in the solar system. I know that the most fuel efficient trajectory (ignoring gravity assists) between, say, Earth and Mars is a Hohmann transfer orbit. This involves accelerating along the starting orbit to raise the aphelion, which is timed to line up with the target in both space and time. Given our current propulsion technology, a Hohmann transfer or some similar variation is the only feasible trajectory.\n\nWith magic sci-fi engines that can output a high level of constant thrust indefinitely (like 1+ g's), such as the Epstein drive in *the Expanse*, the trajectory becomes a ""flip and burn"" scenario where the spacecraft accelerates toward the target for half the journey, then flips around to decelerate for the second half. Journeys take days rather than months, and the trajectory is nearly a straight line.\n\nThat was a rather long-winded introduction, but my question is the following - imagine a ship has an onboard fusion reactor which powers some form of highly efficient electric propulsion. This lets the ship accelerate essentially indefinitely, but only at a fraction of a g (let's say less than 1 m/s\^2 or even less). **What shape does the optimal trajectory become?** Gravity is no longer ""negligible"" as in the flip and burn scenario, but the journey would still be far faster than a traditional transfer orbit with just a single burn at the start and end.",Physics

"Disease is a big factor. New strains of viruses and bacteria appear (or change in frequency) every year, making pathogen-resistance alleles come and go as well, almost like yearly fashion trends.\n\nThere are planktonic animals that make resting stages (e.g. eggs) that sink to the bottom of the pond and can stay in suspended animations for several years. In [one classic study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06291), old resting stages of *Daphnia* (along with their pathogens) were dug out of the mud and reanimated. This is basically like using a time machine to hop back and forth and systematically cross-expose parasites and hosts from different time periods. One cool result was that the pathogens tended to be more able to infect *Daphnia* from the same year, showing that pathogens evolve to become especially good at infecting whatever genotypes are in the host population at the moment.\n\nWeather is another big factor. For species that reproduce fast, it can even change the population within a single year. There's a really cool study system of wild fruit flies in orchards in North America. The researchers working in the orchards have shown that allele frequencies change every year from spring to fall, as the weather becomes warmer and warmer, favoring genotypes that are good at living in warm conditions (the same alleles that are more common farther south, in fact). Then winter comes, and the population is ""reset"" as genotypes that are good at handling cold become favored instead. So it's easy to see how warm years and cold years would have a similar effect.",Biology

"Simply put, inertia is the tendency of an object to keep doing what it's doing. Newton's first law of motion is also called the law of inertia commonly said as ""an object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest unless acted upon by an outside unbalanced force."" In classical mechanics, gravity is just another force so if the gravitational force isn't balanced out by some other force then the object will accelerate according to Newton's second law.\n\nYou can also think of inertia as related to mass. It is harder to slow down a train moving at 50 m/s than it is to slow down a ball of paper moving at 50 m/s. And an object moving 1000 km/s in deep space (i.e. away from the influence of other objects' gravity) will continue to move 1000 km/s in the same direction until something changes that. \n\nPhysicists sometimes distinguish between inertial mass and gravitational mass though experimentally they've always been measured to be the same thing. In this case, inertial mass is the mass you see in Newton's second law when written as F=ma and gravitational mass creating the gravitational potential in the equation U = -Gm/r. Inertial mass would relate a force on an object to its overall acceleration whereas gravitational mass determines how much gravity an object has. Though again as far as we can tell they're the same.\n\nInertia also increases without bound as you push an object closer and closer to the speed of light. In other words, it gets harder and harder to speed up an object as you push it closer and closer to the speed of light.\n\nA final note on inertia there's also rotational inertia, which is the rotational analog of mass. Something with a higher moment of inertia is both harder to start spinning and harder to stop spinning. Moment of inertia (the official name for rotational inertia) depends not only on the mass of the object but also the distribution of mass away from the axis of rotation. A simple demonstration to see this is to take a meterstick and twirl it around its center vs trying to twirl it with the same force about one end. It's a lot harder to sping around one end because the mass is on average further away from the axis of rotation.",Physics

"If you try to think about this as if it is a real event I think you will find it easier to find the correct shape.\n\nThe answer is c.\nThe reason for this is to do with horizontal wind resistance (which is the same as if the helicopter were stationary and a constant wind were blowing from the side). The rope is pulled down by its own weight, but is trying to be blown horizontal by the air resistance. At the top of the rope, there is more weight from the rope below pulling down, so the air resistance is less able to blow it sideways and the rope hangs straight-er down. Nearer the bottom there is less weight pulling down on the rope, so the air resistance can blow the rope horizontally more easily.",Physics

"This it not something I am an expert at, it's just my current understanding: \n\n**Conjugation** is the transfer of genetic material through touch. In Bacteria this is a very small bit of naked DNA that travels through a specialized appendage. The conjugation process of the eukaryote *Paramecium* is different because like all ciliates *Paramecium* has two nuclei, a large and a small, and during conjugation the small nucleus undergoes meiosis and haploid small nuclei are exchanged with the mate. Conjugation in the *Paramecium* results in genetic variation, but does not result in additional organisms, so it is *sexual* but it is not *reproductive*.\n\n**Plasmogamy** is the fusion of the protoplasm of two cells (they share a cell membrane) without a nuclear fusion, and I think it is generally used to describe Fungi. My understanding is plasmogamy in fungi (resulting in the dikaryotic cell) is always ultimately followed by a delayed karyogamy. From what I can tell, the process by which *Paramecium* trades nuclei involves plasmogamy as well, but I don't see the word used in that context, so maybe there is some subtlety I am not aware of, or a preferred synonym. More on this below.\n\n**Karyogamy** is the fusion of nuclei.\n\n**Syngamy** is the fusion of two haploid gametes to form a diploid cell (it is called fertilization in some organisms). Plasmogamy and karyogamy are stage 1 and 2 of syngamy and typically progress quickly except in dikaryotic fungi.\n\nPlasmodial slime molds hatch as unicellular amoebas which are haploid gametes (well, sometimes...) and when two sexually compatible amoebas meet they fuse their cytoplasm (plasmogamy) and nuclei (karyogamy) together to become a diploid cell (syngamy), then repeatedly divide their nuclei without cell division to grow to a macroscopic size. To my knowledge, slimes do not perform conjugation, but I have seen that terminology used in older papers. Unfortunately it is not always clear when a scientific term is being used to describe analogous or unrelated processes. Part of the problem with terminology is words can have drastically different definitions in different fields, or even in the same field. ""Guttation"" exists in plants, fungi, and slimes but is not an analogous process, for example. ""Conjugation"" likewise describes two very different processes in bacteria and ciliate eukaryotes. And so plasmogamy, karyogamy, and syngamy may not describe identical processes in different types of organisms, or may be replaced by other synonyms. Hopefully someone with more knowledge can add to this.",Biology

Instead, glucose can be converted into glycogen, which is a fuel-storage molecule. \n\nGlycogen stores are limited, but fat stores are virtually infinite, so if you overeat, your body tends to start producing fat stores. For creation of fat stores, glucose is converted into triglycerides (basically fat) and it is stored as fat in your body.",Biology

"A valuable lesson to learn if you're interested in chemistry is that 'rules' like 'always wanting to match the nearest noble gas' are almost always simplifications that don't always apply and reality is often a lot more complicated. \n\n In this case, there are a lot of factors that go into what oxidation states an element can be found in (which is essentially what you're asking here) such as having a filled (or half filled) electron shell (or subshell), which orbitals you're adding/removing electrons to/from, how much shielding from inner electrons there is and even relativity comes into it. For thallium specifically, from what I can tell it seems like it most commonly either loses 1 or 3 electrons, but other oxidation states are also possible.",Chemistry

"One should keep in mind that most dark matter ""alternatives"", including this one, actually include dark matter. It says so right on the 2nd page of their paper:\n\n> Consider requirement (iii), that is, successful cosmology. In (2) we have a new d.o.f. φ [...] What should the expectation for a cosmological evolution of ϕ be? The MOND law for galaxies is silent regarding this matter. There is, however, another empirical law which concerns cosmology: the existence of sizable amounts of energy density scaling precisely as a^(−3).\n\nIn other words, they are saying that to get the cosmology right, they need to add dark matter -- that is what they are alluding to with the ""sizable amounts of energy"". They make their φ field play this role. It's just like TeVeS, the other major relativistic MOND theory, where the scalar ""S"" field does the same thing.\n\nThe popular press likes to frame the debate as ""dark matter vs. modified gravity"", but it's really ""dark matter vs. dark matter plus modified gravity"". The hope is that adding a modification of gravity will help fit the galaxy rotation curves better, at the cost of higher theoretical complexity. If you read the paper, the authors aren’t trying to do away with dark matter at all — their primary achievement is getting their modified gravity theory to work out despite the many theoretical obstacles.\n\n---\n\nEdit: I also feel like I should respond to the other top comment which complains modifying gravity is ""less elegant"" than dark matter. These days, dark matter models are not about elegance at all, they're about minimality: trying to account for it by adding just one or two kinds of particles, with the simplest possible interactions, focusing on the dumbest possible first guess. There was an era where people to make dark matter ""elegantly"" fall out as a secondary consequence of adding 100 new particles in a grand theory that also solved every other problem in the Standard Model at once, but that ship has sailed because those theories didn't work. As scientists we should just follow the evidence, without theoretical prejudice. It just so happens that at the moment most of the evidence points towards dark matter.",Physics

"He sounds really cynical and like he doesn’t believe his patients. Or that he’s already got a conclusion in mind and is out to DISPROVE NDEs. When we set out with a bias, it’s difficult to conduct experiments without bringing that bias along. \nI listened to most of the 300 episodes of a NDE podcast over the last several years. I find it fascinating because everyone’s experience is unique but they all flow very similarly. Regardless of gender, race, location, culture, or creed - people have extremely similar “spiritual” experiences when they experience an NDE or psychoactive compound. Whether it’s LSD where eyes are open, or DMT with closed eyes while seeing more vividly than ever imagined…the experiences are so strikingly similar. With DMT, why would people see the same “entities” even if they’ve never heard reference of them beforehand? I’m not saying that with DMT you go off on an astral trip and meet inter-dimensional beings. But what IS happening? HOW are our humans brains so alike that we hallucinate the exact same ridiculous looking things in an altered state? How have people completely healed themselves from addictions after “meeting Mother Auyhuasca”? How is that we can consume a substance that causes us to dig into the depths of our psyche and rearrange things so that we can function more easily and understand the world more clearly? There is insurmountable evidence if more than a few scientists would study it and if it wasn’t so damn Taboo to talk about. \n\nIt’s precisely because it’s considered woowoo that there isn’t more in-depth research on the topic or at least not that the public is allowed to know about. It’s precisely why psilocybin, DMT, LSD, and even cannabis have been deemed schedule 1 drugs. Because it usually changes the way we see the world. It usually causes us to “wake up”, from this dumb broken system we’ve created. Why does it do that? Well, we don’t really NEED to understand the why to see that it does, regardless of our understanding. But I do believe we will understand it better someday. Whatever it is, it IS scientific and it just IS the way things are. Either we as humans have the ability to hallucinate the same experiences and exact images as strangers across the globe, or it’s a spiritual experience suggesting that there is way more than just this earthly plane of existence. It’s one of those two things and they are both really freaking cool. If science helps discover the truth, and if spirituality is also the truth, then I expect in the future we will come to accept that they complement each other well. But there is no room for religion (not even the “religion” of faith in science, because it’s still done by man’s hand) when it comes to progress. \n\nObserve and wonder.

"You're just wrong. Yes, the excited vibrational modes can increase the kinetic energy of other molecules in the atmosphere, but CO2 definitely re-emits photons after the initial IR absorption. As with some of your thermodynamics arguments above, it seems like you know enough about some of these things to think that you're right and be able to give a plausible sounding argument, but it seems like you just lack some basic ideas about the specifics. CO2 really does re-emit the photon. Here's a simple link that explains this [fact](https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/how-climate-works/carbon-dioxide-absorbs-and-re-emits-infrared-radiation#:~:text=Molecules%20of%20carbon%20dioxide%20\(CO,from%20infrared%20\(IR\)%20radiation.&text=The%20energy%20from%20the%20photon,by%20emitting%20another%20infrared%20photon.). Here's another [source](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2021/02/25/carbon-dioxide-cause-global-warming/). Beyond these very high level qualitative explanations that re-emission happens, you can also look at a physical chemistry textbook or a solid state physics textbook for a discussion of the interaction between photons and vibrational modes. Madelung's solid state physics book, for example calculates the rate of IR absorption, and you can calculate emission in an analogous way.

All of this is assuming, of course, that you only notice the shot when it just leaves the barrel. It doesn't take into account the tiny bits of time it takes for a trigger pull to translate into a hammer strike, and the travel down the barrel, which would give you more time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if someone shoots at the edge of your body, with a slow shotgun slug, from across a football field, yeah probably. Looking it up some, a 12 gauge is still accurate at that range, but with a significantly decreased amount of force, so your dodge is probably helpful, if you pick the right direction.",Biology

"Alfred Binet's intelligence scale, a prototype for the Stanford-Binet IQ test, was developed with the sole purpose of identifying French children with developmental disabilities so that they could receive extra help in school. Binet's scale assigned children a mental age based on a comparison of their skills with those of ""normally functioning"" children. Binet explicitly warned against dangerous and unsupportable extrapolation of his work, such as using his tests to peg normal children and adults on a single, linear scale of immutable intelligence. Notable American eugenicist, Henry H. Goddard, eager to catalog Americans along just such a scale, promptly ignored Binet's warnings, translated the tests into English, and pushed for their wide-spread use. \n\n[The Eugenic Origins of IQ Testing: Implications for Post-Atkins Litigation](https://via.library.depaul.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1270&context=law-review)",Biology

Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\n\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off. I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body. \n\nWhat is ""excessive expression""?\n\n>There's nothing to support that.

"So it sounds like your less confused about why it's exothermic and more confused about how a metastable system can change phase exothermically. But the thermodynamics doesn't care. Thermodynamics only states how energy will change eventually, there's absolutely no timeline on that change. In other words, thermodynamics states that when the solution crystallizes, it will be exothermic by X amount. That could happen immediately if you cool it too fast and don't achieve that metastable state, or it could happen the moment you give a metastable state a nucleation site. That energy is coming from all the interactions formed and lost (lost interactions with water, gained bonds between ions, in this case), so that energy comes only comes into play when it actually crystallizes. \n\nI'm not going to explain why crystallizing sodium acetate is exothermic here.

"> currently I’m doing maths chem and physics but do you think that’s enough to get a job that pays well?\n\nYes, but that depends on your definition of ""pays well"" and if you're willing to work a job that is unrelated to your major. I could have gone straight from grad school to a physics postdoc that would have paid $60k-$70k, but that just isn't enough money to satisfy me. My area of study in physics didn't line up well with physics industry (read: semiconductors and solid-state).

"I’m sorry. I don’t think you are considering the thermodynamics relevant to the situation. \n\nI don’t know what you mean by “filtering the atmosphere to get to the adsorption part.” The adsorption of CO2 is the same thing as the filtering. The point is to have an adsorbent that is selective for CO2 over other atmospheric gases. \n\nHere are two examples explaining why I don’t think your analysis is correct. First, rather than direct air capture people are working on capturing CO2 from a coal or natural gas flue stream. As mentioned in my previous comment, a coal plant will produce a good deal more CO2 than a natural gas plant will for the same amount of energy generated, but this actually doesn’t matter so much for the point I’m trying to make besides making it likely that you would want a different adsorbent material for the the two cases. If what you’re saying is correct, this work would be a completely pointless endeavor. In order to capture the CO2 from the fossil fuel plants, you would have to generate as much energy as they are generating with renewables. There would be no reason to do this if you were correct, yet this is a very active area of research that gets funding from the DOE and other sources. This is more of “proof by authority” than actually addressing your point with a physical argument, but I mention this because it’s one of the main reasons that I initially was skeptical of your claim. There are likely many hundreds or thousands of scientists currently working on, evaluating, and funding this type of research that your apparently simple argument based on the second law of thermodynamics renders pointless. It seems unlikely to me that so many people just haven’t considered this claim, especially since process modeling on the economic and materials cost of these materials is common as well and in that type of modeling, they develop sophisticated thermodynamic and kinetic models of CO2 capture in specific materials. They wouldn’t continue doing this if it were as simple as just having to input as much energy as you initially got out since then it would be a pointless task. \n\nThe second example is one I alluded to in my previous comment. Suppose in one case that all of our historical emissions were from coal plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_c. Suppose in another case that all of our emissions were from natural gas plants, and these emissions gave us some energy E_n. In both cases there would be the same amount of CO2 in the atmosphere, but E_n > E_c since natural gas emits less CO2 than coal for the same amount of energy generated.  By your argument, in these two scenarios, we would have to generate different amounts of energy to capture this carbon dioxide. This doesn’t make sense, however. Once the carbon dioxide is in the air, it doesn’t matter how it got there. We aren’t trying to turn the CO2 back into coal or back into natural gas. Instead we are trying to get it to bind to some material, and the energy required to make the material and unbind the CO2 later (if that’s required for storing it underground) will be fixed for the same material capturing CO2 from the atmosphere, regardless of the source of the CO2 initially. The material doesn’t care if the CO2 came from coal or a fire or from a person breathing. \n\nTo address some of your other points, CO2 absorbs IR radiation from the atmosphere, but it also re-emits IR radiation. After absorbing light it doesn’t permanently stay in an excited state. \n\nYour fart example misses the point again. The point of carbon capture isn’t to end up with coal or natural gas or whatever else as a byproduct of CO2 capture. The point is going from coal -> CO2 (and other things) -> CO2 bound to some material. It isn’t trying to make something a reversible process.",Physics

This is because each point of space on the wall acts like a very small light. \n\nShadows from the sun have fuzzy edges. The fuzzyness gets smaller as you get closer to the ground.

"First: There is a difference between ""natural occurring nuclides"" and ""primordial nuclides"". Natural occurring nuclides are all the nuclides that are found in nature, while primordial are the ones that still exists to today that where here when the earth was formed. The reason why uranium 238 is the heaviest natural occurring nucliede, is because all the other nuclides that have been discovered have half lives less than a million years, and since the earth is ~4,5 billion years they have all decayed. \nToday we know of about 3300 nuclides, most of them are unstable and only exist for less than a couple of minutes.\nIn the 1950s it was believed that some nuclides heavier than Z=92 should have half lives in the magnitude of billions of years. The reason why it was believed, is because the theory of ""the island of stability"" predicted that there should be ""magic numbers"" (the ratio between neutrons to protons) that makes the nucleus ""extremely"" stable. As it turned out when our understanding and theory got better, these super heavy nuclides in the island of stability do have longer half lives than nearby nuclides, but instead of billions of years, they have maybe a couple of years to a couple of 100-1000 years. Which is still a lot more stable than their respective neighbors with half lives of some seconds. \nThe hunt is not over though!

"OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a ""currency"" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good.",Biology

"What I got from this it will technically work but the fillers might cause problem to health. Because I've tried b12 vape juuls and I felt an effect.\n\n>OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.\n\n1. If the B vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the EXcipients/fillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth? Simply with saliva? So can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the B vitamins?\n\n2. All vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective. If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms, so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you won't be able to use it.\n\n3. So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms (vitamins and fillers in supplement) into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb, but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins, so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air? Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesn't recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size. Therefore it has to go trough the gut system. But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs (similarly to the gut) can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers? I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isn't found in the body naturally. But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size? If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally, then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is. When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big. therefore, the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air, so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air, your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally. or exepection",Biology

"To observe something you have to interact with it. Think about how your eyes work: The way you see things is by absorbing the light that bounces off of an object and into your eye. Same thing with particles - the only way to see it is if you physically interact with it. This action “collapses” the wave into the location at which it experienced the interaction. You “see” a particle, but you’re actually just seeing the location when the wave function interacted with whatever you’re using to detect it.\n\nImagine a pond that is perfectly still outside of a single ripple from a stone you threw in. With your eyes open you can see its a continuous wave propagating throughout the surface of the pond. But if you close your eyes, and put your finger just over the waters surface so that the wave barely touches it as it passes, would you still be able to tell it was a wave and not a single drop of water touching your finger?

"See [here (especially citations 10–12)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion#Axion_dark_matter) and [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion#Cosmological_implications) They are their own antiparticle, so when their field ripples, two of them get made at once (instead of a particle-antiparticle pair). During the Big Bang, enormous amounts of energy got noisily distributed into all the different fields, causing random ripples to slosh around in them all the time. It's an open question how much energy might have ended up in the axion field, and how much energy there even is in the vacuum overall, but if the axion field got anywhere close to the amount of energy the other fields seem to have gotten, there should actually be way _more_ primordial axions floating around than we actually observe as dark matter. (Axions are tiny and barely interact with each other, so they only very rarely get opportunities to pair-annihilate, never mind interact anyhow else. Or, the QFT way of looking at this is, the axion field is so weakly coupled to everything, that it's very hard for energy to leave it.) Hence why papers like [this one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/037026938390638X?via%3Dihub) establish _upper_ bounds on the vacuum energy of the axion field.",Physics

Some issues to consider: how to ensure that the new antigen gene gets put in a safe spot of our genome (not splitting important genes); ensuring regular but not too active transcription; would it lead to a sort of ""tolerance"" to the antigen, causing our bodies to no longer react to the antigen.

"Welcome to this puzzling problem set\n\nI am currently doing a reaction in the lab, where I am working with a molecule that contains the moiety shown above.\n\nUpon treatment with base (Carbonate Buffer at ph 9 and 10 as well as in DMF with DIPEA) there are peaks/masses appearing on the LCMS and also it seems like the cleavage of the Thioester just stagnates after a certain point.\n\nIt took me a while to develop ideas what byproducts these masses on the LCMS could belong to\n\n**a:** shows the molecule before treatment with base. This mass also appears after treatment with base which I find quite confusing because I would expect the thioester to be completely broken up\n\n**b:** shows the molecule upon treatment: the thioester is cleaved and the thiol is freed (I also see the mass of the disulfide of b)\n\n**c:** shows the mass of my product without the acetyl-protecting group on the amine. This is something I find super surprising – why should the acetyl be cleaved off? It's an amide, so…super stable? I know what you are about to say: maybe it's just something that happens in the LCMS through ionization! 1. there was an extra peak for this mass in the UV and molecule e also kinda proves that c really exists.  \nAlso, I expect **c** to undergo an S-N acyl shift, so I would obtain an amide and a free cysteine (**shown in d**). They do have the same mass\n\n**e** would be the disulfide formed between the free Thiol of b and d. Upon addition of TCEP to the mixture this mass vanished. This would also prove the S-N acyl shift theory\n\nSo:  1. why is there deacetylation happening in the first place?\n\nAnd here comes the biggest question mark: I have 3 substrates, they all look quite similar to a except they don’t have an acetyl-protected amine (they don't have an amine close to this position at all). Still, they all show these weird rearrangement (or whatever) masses. This would speak for another part of the molecule participating in these side reactions. (the structures drawn above are just interpretations of the masses based on the original molecule)\n\nDo you have any other suggestions about what could happen? Is there another shift I don’t know of between Amides and thioesters? Could the secondary Amine participate in this reaction (because the secondary amine is also present in every substrate)\n\nI am very confused by the outcome of this reaction and any ideas or suggestions would be very appreciated!",Chemistry

"I agree it's interesting, but you should take a lot of those reports with a grain of salt. The more we study things, the more we find there are natural explanations for them.\n\nHere is a [great post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/studying-near-death-experiences/) from a neurologist on NDEs (excerpt below)\n\n>That NDEs occur is not controversial – many people report remembering experiences around the time of cardiac arrest from which they were revived. Typical experiences include a sense of floating outside of one’s body, even looking down upon oneself and the events going on. Some people report a bright light, and others report “passing over” and being greeted by deceased loved-ones. The experience is often peaceful or euphoric, which contrasts to the way people feel when they eventually wake up. Surviving a cardiac arrest takes its toll and is not a pleasant experience.\n\n>The question is not whether or not people have such experiences – the question is how to interpret them. Just as even the most rigorous skeptic does not question that people see UFOs, but rather what the UFOs likely are.\n\n>The burden of proof for anyone claiming that NDEs are evidence for the survival of the self beyond the physical function of the brain is to rule out other more prosaic explanations. This burden has not been met.\n\n>Neuroscientists are piecing together plausible explanations for each of the components of the NDE. The sensation of floating outside one’s body can be reliably induced by suppressing that part of the brain that makes us feel as if we possess our bodies. The experience is identical to that reported by those who have had an NDE. This experience can be replicated by drugs or magnetic stimulation. There are even reports (I have had one such patient) of people who have a typical NDE experience during seizures. The bright light can be explained as a function of hypoxia (relative lack of oxygen) either to the retina or the visual cortex. Any everything else is simply the culturally appropriate hallucinations of a hypoxic brain.",Biology

Get a pHD if you want to be treated well and afford rent. Bachelors level chemists are typically treated like grunts and get paid garbage for their first several years after college. Master’s level chemists are often looked at as “failed pHDs” unless they also have a lot of experience. The problem is that academic/theoretical chemistry experience at the B.S. level doesn’t give enough actual lab experience.

Therefore you’re unfortunately not worth that much to them yet.,Chemistry
"> using vinegar to clean greasy ovens and microwaves\n\nIt's a mild cleaning option.  Perfect for some uses - too slow for others.\n\nThe grease in your oven is mostly food oils.  So it's a mix of triglycerides and burnt carbon deposits, not what you may think of as ""oil"".\n\nThe acetic acid in vinegar is in the neutral or non-ionic form.  Because it's neutral and almost hydrophobic, that allows it to penetrate through the grease to the substrate and then start to swell the grease layer from underneath.  Already that means you lifting the grease away from the surface. \n\nCompare that to a caustic cleaner which is trying to dissolve the grease layer from the top down, almost like sandpapering a surface.  The vinegar penetrating and lifting can allow you to mechanically scrape up chunks instead of dealing with a corrosive mess of liquid, similar to a paint stripper.\n\nDropping the pH will protonate any fatty acids and triglyerides from their ionic form into a neutral non-ionic form.  That also helps break up the grease layer. \n\nCommercial oven cleaner is often a mix of caustic soda and an organic amine penetrating chemical.  Best of both worlds, it penetrates to lift from the surface, plus its cuastic to start dissolving from the top down.\n\nDistilled white vinegar is fantastic at polishing mirrors, glass, counter tops and handrails because it doesn't leave any residue.

"You make some fair points, but I’m a little unsure about your main argument. \n\nAre you saying that all of the energy gained from the past 100-150 years of burning fossil fuels would have to be used to capture the CO2 in the atmosphere, and that we won’t be able to generate that much energy because we will also have to be powering society with renewables? If this isn’t what you’re saying, then I just misunderstood, but as far as I’m aware, I don’t think that this is right. \n\nFirst, over time we have been gradually getting more energy for the amount of emissions that are produced. Natural gas flue streams have much less CO2 than coal streams, making carbon capture from them more difficult (you allude to this in your comment above), but also meaning that we could be getting more energy per emissions out of natural gas than coal. I don’t know if the natural gas gives less energy than coal so it balances out to be the same energy per emissions (if so, I would be interested in seeing a source on this). Also, either way I agree we shouldn’t be using fossil fuels for energy. I’m not a “clean coal” or natural gas advocate. \n\nSecond, different materials require different energy inputs to adsorb and to release CO2. It’s not a fixed cost for every material. I can’t tell if I’m missing some basic thermodynamic argument for why the energy cost to capture must equal the energy cost to release, because we aren’t trying to “unburn the coal.” Initially we had coal -> energy and CO2, but now we are trying to go from CO2 -> something that isn’t coal. This can be CO2 bound to amines in aqueous amine solutions or CO2 bound to some calcium compound among other things, but I don’t think the energy required for the adsorption has to be equal to the initial energy used.",Physics

Then learn what a chemical bond is and why it is formed, what types of bonds there are but also rules about how many bonds which element tends to form and why / tendenc to give awy / take up electrons (noble gas configuration).
