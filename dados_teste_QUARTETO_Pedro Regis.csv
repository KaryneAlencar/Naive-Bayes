That is the reaction why it turns from green to colorless. And through excessive KMnO4 it turns pink.\n\nYour orange color comes from small ammount of MnO2.\n\nYour reaction is basicly MnO4- + 8H+ + 5Fe2+ -> Mn2+ + 4H2O + 5Fe3+\n\nwhen not enough iron2+ are left it can occur that you will get Mn4+ insted of Mn2+. This colours the solution in orange,Chemistry

"Hijacking and extending this answer: I'd add that the total shadow is a convolution of the light sources and the towel.

If, instead of a towel on a surface, you replace it with a single hole in the light blocking object, what you end up with is a [camera obscura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsXo4gD7iWI).

"To make it easier to see that the center ring is indeed an 18 electron system, pretend the benzene rings don't exist and assign electron counts to the atoms and charges in the central main ring then add them. eg. C and N are 1 each [as long as the Nitrogen is not connected to more than 2 atoms in a ring system other than the outward pointing R groups eg. in quinozolium the Nitrogen counts as 2 electrons] and every excess electron in the negatively charged ring is 1 each. There are 6 Nitrogens, 2 extra electrons and 10 Carbons which sums to 6 + 2 + 10 = 18.\n\nAnother way is to again, erase the benzene rings and draw the center ring without them attached. You'll end up with 7 double bonds and 2 amine like Nitrogens in one of the resonance structures that you can draw. Each double bond counts as 2 electrons and each amine like Nitrogen also counts as 2 which results in a total count of 7 x 2 + 2 x 2 = 18.\n\nWhile the benzene rings do interact and share electron density with the central ring, for most purposes they can be treated as separate ring systems.",Chemistry

When a rocket is moving quickly, the rocket is extracting more kinetic energy from the fuel than it does at rest (as seen from an outside observer).\n\nKeep in mind that chemical energy rockets do not follow F=ma, and their acceleration is not constant nor proportional to their instantaneous mass (the actual equation is F = m * dV/dt + dm/dt * V, though if the fuel mass flow is small compared to the rocket mass, F=ma is pretty dang close).",Physics

"Start simple. \n\nModelling things like this usually involves calculating the result numerically because the analytic results can get out of hand quickly. \n\nThe simplest numerical method is finite difference on a regular grid - you're essentially sampling the field at the grid points. Since this is a vector field, you'd need a 3d value at each point. You can convert the field equations to finite difference representations, and then look at how the results depend on the grid spacing.\n\nFEMM is based on the observation that a lot of the space will be oversampled (lots of points in a relatively uninteresting bit of field) in order to give enough points to the interesting bits. So instead we can collect regions of space together and call each one an element, and then put more smaller elements in the interesting bits of space, and fewer in the empty bits. This way the calculation effort is concentrated where it is needed. \n\nThe cost, though, is that FEMM is far more complex to understand, and involves choices about how you will set up your elements and whether you will dynamically add or change those elements as the calculation progresses (e.g. adapting to the shape of the field, or for time-dependent calculations). So I'd recommend starting with finite difference, then at least you have a solution you can compare a FEMM solution to.",Physics

"Within the Standard Model of particle physics, electrons are part of a group of particles called leptons, which also includes the electron's heavier brothers the muon and the tauon, and their respective neutrinos. Electrons differ from muons and tauons only in mass: their charge and other fundamental properties are exactly the same.\n\nWe expect that the muon, being a heavier lepton, will decay into an electron over time, as will the tauon, which can decay into a muon or an electron. Importantly however, the Standard Model predicts that the decay rate from a tauon to an electron should be the same as the decay rate from a muon to an electron, up to a factor of their masses. As all the other properties between muons and tauons are the same, only their *mass* can affect the decay rate. This is called *lepton universality*, and it basically means that leptons only differ from each other in their mass, and interactions cannot depend on their flavor.\n\nA test of lepton universality is to take very heavy mesons, like the B meson (which contains a bottom quark), and observe its decay. B mesons will decay into K mesons by having their bottom quark decay into a strange quark, and this decay is mediated by the weak force, which allows coupling to leptons. Lepton universality then allows us to predict how many muons vs tauons we expect to see when these decays happen, and a couple of years ago we found a 2-3œÉ deviation from the theory, suggesting that lepton universality is not correct. This deviation was not large enough however to warrant a claim of ""new physics"" having been observed, for that we would need a >5œÉ detection.\n\nThe new results from LHCb repeat this 2-3œÉ deviation. It's consistent, but still not sufficient for new physics.",Physics

The main idea is summed up by Dehaene as:\n\n> When we say that we are aware of a certain piece of information, what we mean is just this: the information has entered into a specific storage area that makes it available to the rest of the brain. Among the millions of mental representations that constantly crisscross our brains in an unconscious manner, one is selected because of its relevance to our present goals. Consciousness makes it globally available to all our high-level decision systems. We possess a mental router, an evolved architecture for extracting relevant information and dispatching it.\n\n> ‚Ä¶According to this theory, consciousness is just brain-wide information sharing. Whatever we become conscious of, we can hold it in our mind long after the corresponding stimulation has disappeared from the outside world.

"""not influenced by internal or external stimuli"", how can anything do anything if it doesn't have a reason to?\n\nIf free will is being unfettered by things like instinct (internal stimuli) that drive me to eat when I'm hungry and avoid bodily harm (external stimuli perceived as ""danger""), then an actor with free will should be just as likely to step into traffic and die as not, with the randomness of a coin flip. I think your definition of free will is insufficient.\n\nIn AI and economics there is the concept of an agent with goals. A rational agent acts to achieve some goal (win the chess game, get the car to the destination) by choosing actions, or sequences of actions, based on their perceived utility towards achieving that goal. Things in the real world have a finite perception of the options they have and the consequences of their actions, and often even a limited conscious understanding of their own goals,  easily confusing the utility measured towards towards their final goals (??) with utility towards lesser goals instrumental towards final goals (reproduction, consuming calories in preparation for hard times, etc).\n\nMillions of years of evolution and a lifetime of social conditioning have been tweaking the way species and individuals perceive and weigh their options in different situations. I think the search for ""free will"" ultimately demands a distinction without a difference and uninteresting compared to studying biology, psychology, sociology, cultural anthropology, etc.\n\nThis is a very liberal arts degree take (as my psychology and sociology education ends at the 200 level in the New York state undergraduate system), but I like Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development as a starting point for modeling and qualifying different types of actors.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg's_stages_of_moral_development\n\nHe distinguishes the person (often as stages of life from infancy to adulthood) who only makes choices to avoid negative stimuli (punishment, hunger), with a person who acts toward some perception of right and wrong, and from there distinguishes where they get their sense of right and wrong-- does their friend group or society dictate their morals or do they have their own moral system that they would listen to over the rules society provides.\n\nIt's very simplistic and self contradictory. Like Heath Ledger's Joker could be argued to be level 2 like a pleasure seeking child as well as he could be argued to be a transcendent level 6 with his own higher moral code. But I think it's a fun place to start.",Physics

While I was in college, I didn't do any research and didn't form relationships with professors (which, in hindsight, was obviously pretty dumb). My grades were good, at least.\n\nSince graduating, I've been working in a lab in (I guess?) industry, doing mostly formulations-related stuff (largely in a box) as well as a couple of other projects in general. Although the work that I do on a daily basis is literally ""chemistry"" and literally ""research"", a lot of it is grunt work.

"My knowledge of the nutrition literature is very sketchy further back than the year 2000.\n\nThe 9 essential amino acids were known by the 1940s. Its the same 9 essential amino acids for humans, cows, chickens, and *all* animals. No animal is an essential amino acid producer, they're all ""middlemen"". In evolution, creatures that evolved to eat plants or other animals lost the same set of metabolic pathways early, over 1000 million years ago.\n\nNutritional requirements for protein have become better defined with time. I'd recommend the WHO's [Protein and Amino Acid Requirements in Human Nutrition](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43411/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf;jsessionid=42513E10FE32E690D087BCDF2725806C?sequence=1), from 2007, for the still current consensus.\n\nThe requirements are fairly fixed by lean body mass, and its still common for some elderly to fall short, mostly because they're sedentary and eat so few calories in total that the dietary proportions that served them in youth no longer provide enough protein to support immune function. There's no requirement for the elderly to consume animal products, but for those who consume fewer calories in total, the requirement for protein may rise from the \~10% of calories required in younger people to 15-20% of calories. The additional protein could come from eggs & cheese, or from legumes and tofu.\n\nThere was an [interesting paper from 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155041311400062X) which found mild protein restriction was associated with protection against chronic disease and mortality, but only up to age 65 to 70. After that, higher protein intake in the 10-20% range improved survival. I think in this study we're seeing both some benefit from mild protein restriction in preventing cardiovascular and metabolic disease in middle age, and also a benefit of ensuring enough protein for our immune cells to proliferate in response to infection, in the elderly.\n\nI eat a plant based diet for health, and became fascinated with the nutrition and health literature about a decade ago. Because plant based diets can be unbalanced, I was concerned about the essential amino acids likely to be deficient. The key requirement for  is 30 mg/kg/day of lysine, and 15 mg/kg/day for methionine + cysteine (from table 49 of the WHO document cited above). Meet those, and its pretty much assured the other essential amino acids will be adequate. In practice, it generally means most plant based eaters need 2-3 servings of legumes daily, to ensure adequate lysine.

"Maybe I am wrong but the fact that we have this ""explosive"" behaviour means that the force resisting the opening of the lid is indicative of something non-continuous, like surface tension as you say, or some clipping mechanism to keep the lid in place.\n\nIf it was just the weight of the lid, what i would expect would be for the pressure to slowly build, up to being big enough to slightly lift the lid. Then the lid would lift slightly, pressure would equalize and the process would restart.\n\nIf it's surface tension or a clipping mechanism, the pressure would build up to a level higher than what is needed to just lift the lid a bit. Then it would continue growing until it reached the threshold of the clipping mechanism, or surface tension breaks. At this point the resisting force would disappear altogether, and the build up pressure would lift the lid in a more explosive manner, as we see.",Physics

"The same set of nine essential amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine) are common to all animals, as far I know. In other words, sometime after a heterotrophic lifestyles developed in the pre-Cambrian, key enzymes in those metabolic pathways were lost, probably when our ancestors were single celled protists. Once those critters started eating other critters, there was no selection to conserve those chains of enzymes in the metabolic pathways.\n\nHumans can still synthesize the other proteinogenic amino acids (alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, tyrosine) from other metabolic precursors, though perhaps not at levels ideal for human health. [Glycine](https://www.ias.ac.in/article/fulltext/jbsc/033/05/0771-0780) is of some interest here.\n\n\> Does the body know the difference\n\nYes. Some amino acids serve important signaling functions. For example, the most common essential amino acid, leucine, plays a key role in satiety and in telling individual cells whether they should adopt a anabolic (make stuff) or catabolic (recycle trash) tone. In both cases this is via the remarkable metabolic regulator [MTOR](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=mtor&as_occt=title) (mammalian target of rapamycin).\n\n\> Are these then stored or flushed through the lymphatic, on to elimination systems?\n\nNope. Each individual cell largely is its own factory, responsible for grabbing what it needs from the bloodstream, and discarding what it doesn't via bloodstream. Excess amino acids get excreted via the kidneys.\n\n\> Any good books on the subject?\n\nI have a batchelor's in biochemistry, so I'm not deterred by the jargon, but learned almost nothing about nutrition in my school days. For those with a scientific background like yourself, I'd recommend academic textbooks, like [Modern nutrition in health and disease](https://1lib.us/book/3484357/f6767f).

"Thallium possesses several closed shells of d and f-electrons, but once they are completely filled they tend to become irrelevant. (hence the comparison of distance to xenon and radon is a bit inaccurate) A very important aspect is the inert pair effect of s-electrons. It simply states that as you go to higher rows, e. g within the 3rd main group from boron to aluminium to gallium to indium and finally to thallium, the s-electrons become increasingly more difficult to access. The effect originates from quantum mechanics. This means in essence that the tendency of being most stable in the +I compared to the +III state increases with increasing mass of the element. In other words, removing both s-electrons from the valence shell of thallium is more difficult than for indium, gallium, aluminium or boron. (The same trend applies also to the 4th and somewhat to the 5th main group) Negative oxidation states are for  elements of the 3rd main group exceedingly rare, because their electromegativities are relatively low. This means that the valence shell of thallium for example is barely capable of accommodating one additional electron. negatively charged thallium ions are therefore rarely formed. It may be possible that stuff like CsTl exists, but I would not bet on it.",Chemistry

"I would argue this phenomenon is the plate body behaving like a glider in the ground-effect region, and so extremely close to the ground, that viscous drag forces enter the system as well. \n\n(No particular order)\nEffect 1: as the plate approaches the floor at constant speed, the volume of air remaining below the plate diminishes linearly with the distance, so the exit-air‚Äôs volume flow rate should be constant over plate distance by this geometry. \n\nEffect 2: as the distance diminishes, the size of the escape windows for the air diminishes linearly. \n\nCombining 1 and 2, you have a constant volume flow rate getting restricted to a smaller and smaller conduit. The fluid speed tries to increase to maintain constant flow rate and constant plate speed, but this acceleration takes work. And the work done to accelerate the air is  coming from the plate‚Äôs downward kinetic energy. Therefore the plate slows down (at least in part) from this principle of needing to accelerate a fluid. \n\nEffect 3: when the plate gap gets quite small, there is now an exponentially increasing viscous drag impeding the air‚Äôs acceleration along the escape path. The air‚Äôs inability to get out fast enough causes a pressure rise, and the plate‚Äôs downward motion is decelerated even stronger now. Now it‚Äôs on a more pronounced ‚Äúair cushion‚Äù but time is limited before it runs out. \n\nEffect 4: For very light and very large plate, there exists a critical gap size where the rising air pressure is almost able to counter the weight of the plate. It appears floating, initial downward speed is gone, but a small downward speed is still required for the air‚Äôs pressure to remain high. Now that the plate‚Äôs weight is almost balanced, the motion from here forward is now roughly constant. The plate approaches the floor at a constant speed in this regime, where the work of gravity on the plate equals the work required to force the viscous air through this tiny gap. \n\nEffect 5: now the plate may have had some forward momentum! Or otherwise, with the plate in the floating regime, air might realistically leave faster on one side, giving the plate a tilt. Now it ‚Äúslides downhill‚Äù on this inclined air cushion. \n\nEffect 6: there now also exists some forward speed of the plate where the fresh air entering the leading edge of the gap is almost able to feed and sustain the air cushion indefinitely. The plate‚Äôs slow, constant descent onto the floor is now delayed even further by this \n\nIn all, the total combination of these effects can make falling, light, large plates stop descending, start sliding forward, and take a very unexpectedly long time to actually hit the floor and stop moving.",Physics

"My lab was not the most smelly lab in the world. We did not make any iffy 'fine' organic synthesis. Just a bunch of chemicals, and nothing really exotic.\n\nWe had piperidine, and tetrahydropyrimidine, both smelled somewhere on the bad side of the spectrum. Can't speak much about thiophenol - it was contained safely in a well-corked vial with several layers of polyetylene zip-bags, inside a glass bottle, and all in the fridge at +3 celsius. Whoever had packed it so well was clearly not intended to open it anytime soon.\n\nOxygen compounds have rather pleasant smell - methyl-tert-butyl ether, methyl-isobutyl ketone, 2-hexanone (methyl-butyl ketone). Furfural and furane and tetrahydrofurane (however the last one is borderline pleasant). Monoethanolamine is another one which is at the same time good and bad.\n\nDimethylsulphide is probably bad but we had it very diluted (somewhat 0.1% mass in propane). Dibuthylsulphide, on another hand, we had as a pure substance - and it is not pleasant at all, just believe me.\n\nBut the worst one was not the pure substance but the industrial byproduct (or, rather, residue). A greedy client hired us to determine what good - if any - contain his residues. It were residuals from olefine production, and from that fact you may tell they smelled horribly. He basically had a dozen of railroad tanks of that shit. Lighter products contained mostly butadienes (from which the 1,2-butadiene was the major one, defying thermodynamics), and the rest was a cocktail from hell - butyne-1, butyne-2, vinylacetylene and products of their polymerization. (I learned from literature that vinylacetylene is not only prone to polymerization - but it performs it so eagerly that it often proceeds with explosion. Thankfully, we did not learned that from first-hand experience!). \n\nHeavier fraction was not any better. We analyzed it with the method ASTM D 6730 (with huge red remark that this metod was not developed to determination of composition of so miserable, bad-looking, skunk-smelling devil mixtures). Oh dear. The majority, turns out, was styrene - upto 30%, and it by itself is not the best thing to work - not only it smells horribly, it also may be referred as a liquified cancer.  The rest were various compounds of various degrees of unsaturation, partially polymerized, partially oxidated, and believe me, the entire chromatogram was something to see - and to stick labels to various peaks. The test method had the relative retention times for approx 500 compounds - we found them all (discovered by the way there are some incorrect peaks in the reference table), but we also had several dozens which we can't stick a label to.

"Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \n\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the ""right time"", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\n\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\n\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies.",Biology

"1.The fact that he's young and healthy doesn't necessarily mean COVID won't hit him hard. Plus, the more people are vaccinated the better because the virus won't be able to transmit so easily, replicate and MUTATE. So we are more likely to get worse COVID variants if there are not enough people vaccinated. Not to mention there's a higher chance that he will spread it to his grandma or something. \n\n2. I honestly can't think how you can hit an artery in the upper arm muscle? Or even a major blood vessel.   But let's assume the vaccine goes straight into the blood stream. Nano-lipid particles are quite fragile. They're often covered in PEG to even make them stay longer in the bloodstream otherwise they would get opsonised and eaten by macrophages quickly. In order for these nano-lipids to ""enter every cell of the body"" they would have to extravasate from the blood stream and that wouldn't be so easy either (not to mention there wouldn't be enough of them to enter every cell). Usually people rely on cancer vasculature to be more ""leaky"" and try to use liposomes as drug carriers for instance. Because they would in theory accumulate in tumour. Probably the worst case scenario if by some miracle you injected the vaccine into the bloodstream would be that you might not develop an immunological memory for COVID or feel a bit worse. Even if mRNA entered some other cells, they would just start producing this spike protein. And sure, the immune cells would destroy these ""infected"" cells but there's nowhere near enough mRNA injected to cause any real damage that way (especially if it's dispersed and ""diluted"" in your body in this scenario). So essentially in the muscle the cells will start producing the spike protein (which is not secretory because some people wrongly suggest that you have a lot of this protein accumulated in your body), the immune cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) would find it, carry it to lymph nodes and activate T cells and B cells. There are a lot of DCs in the muscle so it's a great place to inject a vaccine. \n\n3. I honestly can't see how an mRNA vaccine can mess up your immune system and make it not work properly. It just mimicks what happens in any other viral infection. Your friend's argument is sooo general it's annoying. If he told you a suggested mechanism of action of this, then we can discuss. But like this? He should provide a source with a proof of that. \n\n4. Some people already answered. I don't really know the history of mRNA vaccine clinical trials so I won't say much. But let's not forget some companies didn't manage to make good mRNA vaccines for COVID (and tried), and that a lot of money and effort from thousands of scientist went to make these vaccines work. That for sure played a part in this success. \n\n5. I really don't like anegdotal evidence. What does it mean he ""measured""?

"Consider any point along the rope. The question now is, how is air resistance and gravity affecting the rope beneath it? That determines in which direction the rope beneath that point is pulling that point on the rope.\n\nWell, gravity is proportional to the mass of that length of rope, which is proportional to the length of the rope.\n\nAir resistance is proportional to the wind-facing surface area of the rope, which is *also* proportional to the length of the rope.\n\nSince these are both proportional to length, as you move down the rope, neither the downward effect of gravity or the approximately horizontal effect of air resistance is able to pull ahead, and the rope is just pulled in the same direction for the entire length.\n\n----\n\nHere is a more mathematically rigorous explanation:\n\nConsider an arbitrary length of the rope.\n\nIgnoring other attached segments of rope (which should behave identically), and thus their tension forces, there are two forces acting on the rope: gravity, and air resistance.\n\nNet air resistance is proportional to the length of the rope, because the rope's wind-facing area is proportional to its length.\n\nNet gravitational force is *also* proportional to the length of the rope, because the rope's mass is proportional to its length.\n\nThus, the net force is given by:\n\n- **F**_net = **F**_a + **F**_g = L\***f**_a + L\***f**_g = L\*(**f**_a + **f**_g)\n\nwhere **F**_a and **F**_g are air resist. and gravity, L is rope length, and **f**_a and **f**_g are the ""per-length"" air resist. and gravity forces.\n\nSince the rope is of uniform mass, **f**_g is constant for the entire rope, since gravity is approximately constant along the whole rope, which is short compared to the size of the Earth.\n\nIf we assume approximately constant air velocity and air density/makeup around the entire length of the rope, then we also get that **f**_a is constant for the entire rope.\n\nSince **f**_a and **f**_g are constant for the whole rope, so is there sum. This means that we have:\n\n- **F**_net = L\***k**\n\nwhere **k** = **f**_a + **f**_g is a constant vector.\n\nAll this math has resulted in the above equation, which alone tells us the rope should be straight and look like (B). The net force for every segment of rope along the rope, before accounting for tension forces, is in the same direction. When you add tension forces, those will only act parallel or anti-parallel to this net force.\n\nThus, the net force along the entire rope will be parallel to a constant direction, which is a straight line.",Physics

If we look at a point at the bottom, the mass of rope applying tension is much less.

"Neutrons decay by emitting a Beta particle (electron) and a neutrino and end up as a proton (there‚Äôs a bit more that happens under the hood with quarks, but from the outside looking in this is the end product).  As a free particle, a neutron has more energy than a proton, electron, and neutrino combined.  This means that the neutron will tend to go to a lower energy state by changing into a proton.\n\nIn a nucleus, a neutron has the same potential energy as before, but now there are other positive particles nearby - protons.  To turn into a proton while surrounded by protons requires energy: the same energy as bringing a proton to the nucleus from infinitely far.  In stable nuclei, this requires more energy than would be released by the neutron during decay.  Therefore the event is exceptionally rare or practically never happens.  It‚Äôs as if the surrounding protons are gatekeeping the neutron and not allowing it to decay.\n\nIn some larger nuclei, where there are a lot of neutrons relative to protons, there aren‚Äôt as many protons to repel the potential new proton and more surrounding neutrons with favorable binding energy through the strong nuclear force.  These nuclei do have neutrons decay into protons through beta decay.",Physics

"There's no sterile neutrino that's been discovered. When physicists talk about how we *know* the universe works, there's three active neutrinos and no steriles. There's always searches for new physics going on, and people look in the most likely places (whether that seems most likely because of theory, or because of data).\n\nThere are unexplained experimental signals from two experiments, LSND and MiniBooNE that could both be simultaneously explained by a sterile neutrino at around 1eV^2. This was far from enough for physicists to consider it a discovery, but it's a very, very good reason to do experiments to clarify.\n\nPhysicists don't consider the sterile neutrino to exist, it's considered a plausible hypothetical.\n\nBut the LSND-MiniBooNE data exist. It shows something not understood that needs to be. Part of the reason that LSND and MiniBooNE together is compelling is that they're almost  completely different in the way they work, they're completely different types of neutrino source, detector and interaction physics. It's weird that two experiments that were so different came out with results consistent with the same hypothetical particle (although they are not the only experiments in the world, and if you start combining everything in the world that could theoretically see that particle it gets less convincing).\n\nMicroBooNE was made to be a *lot* like MiniBooNE. It's using the same neutrino source, it's in almost exactly the same place (geographically, they're right next to each other, for physics purposes they're at almost the same distance from the source). MiniBooNE had a weakness - it was not good at telling the difference between electrons and photons. MicroBooNE was designed to be able to do that. So the analyses that were released look for the MiniBooNE event excess either as plausibly coming from electrons or from photons. The analyses that have been shown aren't explicitly stating ""does a sterile neutrino exist"", they're saying ""do we see the same excess as MiniBooNE"", somewhat agnostic to whatever the underlying reason for the excess is. If it's electrons, that's exciting and evidence that goes towards there being a sterile neutrino. If it's photons, that's less exciting and goes toward the idea a background at MiniBooNE was modelled inaccurately. What MicroBooNE actually saw was neither of those things - that the MiniBooNE signal didn't show up at all (at a pretty mediocre statistical signifiance, enough to say ""probably"" but not enough to rule anything out). But if that's true, there's got to be another reason. 3+1 (adding one sterile to the known three active neutrinos) is what experimental physicists talk about because it's the least you have to mess with the model to make it fit the data from these specific experiments. Theoretical physicists talk about a *lot* more things, because they're looking at *theories* that make sense, not just trying to make their data fit.\n\nSo, this is a negative result. It's not a particularly conclusive one, but it is an important one. It's interesting, it's told us a lot, but I probably wouldn't go so far as to say ""heralds new chapter in physics"". Something is going on with the LSND-MiniBooNE signal. MicroBooNE not seeing makes it weirder - which could be physics that is even more exotic (or, in the worst case could be that MiniBooNE and LSND somehow both screwed up in entirely different ways that were somehow very consistent). But there's a strong experimental program under construction to iron this out (or possibly just make the puzzle more confusing). You should look forward to more updates - and understand that there's not just a new fundamental particle every few years: physicists are looking for how the universe works, but they don't get to decide how the universe works, only where are the best places to look for something new. And this is still a great place to look, even given the negative results presented this week.",Physics

"Well, it depends on the situation. Generally I'd say the quote as stated is not wrong (it's imprecise, as it is a statement in words and not one in mathematics, but it's at least not wrong). \n\nThere are situations where a quantum system is in only one state. We might not know in what state it is, but it's definitely in one and only one state.\n\nIn other situations a quantum system can be in a superposition of multiple states (that can be all possible states, it can also be only two of many possible states). A superposition of multiple states is what popular science calls ""in many states at once"" (one can definitely discuss how accurate this description is, but I think it's the most accurate, non-mathematical, description one can give). If you measure such a superposition state you will however only observe one of the states that made up the superposition (much like the example of the cat, that's why I said: if a cat was a quantum system the example would be true).\n\nWhich of the two situations apply, depends on your experimental setup. The important thing is that the measurement statistics of these two situations are different. If you give me a quantum system, and don't tell me whether it's in one state (but don't tell me which) or whether it's in a superposition af multiple states, I will be able to tell. Sounds counter intuitive, but that's just because writing it out in words introduces imprecisions.",Physics

They measured that with an uncertainty of 10% or so, figure 4 in the paper. A high school experiment with a pendulum can measure the local gravitational acceleration more precisely. A good gravimeter will measure the local gravitational acceleration with a relative uncertainty below 10^(-10).\n\nNone of these give a good measurement for G because we don't know the mass of Earth precisely enough (our best estimate comes from using G to calculate the mass, so you can't do the reverse). To measure big G you need to measure the force between two (known) masses in the lab. The time dilation from that is far too small.",Physics

At low pH, you will see more small-molecule dehydration products like furans that contribute more to flavor but browning will be slower. \n\nAs for bread browning and flavor, both caramelization and the Maillard reaction will occur. The Maillard reaction is significantly inhibited at low pH. It involves the reaction of amino acids and reducing sugars. At low pH, the amino acids are protonated and become poor nucleophiles, so the Maillard reaction is slowed. It will still occur, however, and lead to different products just like caramelization.\n\nLow pH Maillard products generally have more meaty aromas while high-pH Maillard products generally have more roasty and nutty aromas.",Chemistry

"Okay that makes more sense to me. In that case, it's either a kinetic or thermodynamic thing. It's probably not kinetic but just in case, you could try cooling it more slowly. Idk what the water content is in the microwave so either inject it into hot water and let cool or let it cool and then inject it into the regular water. I don't think this will work but maybe.\n\nOtherwise, the issue seems to be one of partitioning. You have 2 phases, either stearic acid in the SLN or the lipid tails of the tween 20. As is, they are virtually identical. Both are totally unsaturated long carbon chains. Could you try altering composition of the lipid core to make a more distinct difference in phase? Clotrimazole is highly aromatic so while it will dissolve in aliphatic substances, it should still prefer aromatic substances. If you can up the aromatic content of your SLN, it might stay in place more. Aromatic body friendly things seem rare though. Cholesterols or some unsaturated fats maybe? Some vitamin B's or E look promising. Tryptophan might even work. \n\nCome to think of it, the whole thing is weird to me. It's a little weird that you have SLN's and micelles both existing. It seems like there's just too much surfactant as it means your covering the SLN's entirely and still have enough left over to be above the cmc. But the other bit that's weird is that a drug dissolved in a SOLID lipid core is partitioning into the micelle phase. If it's solid, it shouldn't really move and definitely not partition into a micelle phase. So... kinetics might not actually be far off. I was thinking of micelle formation before but you might need to worry about the SLN formation. If you can get the SLN's formed before diluting, you should be golden. But I'm guessing that's the whole cold water step and it will fail otherwise. I'm kind of curious what happens if you just microwave the drug and stearic acid by themselves and then inject them straight into water. It will fall out of solution, but if it forms the right sized particles, you might be able to add your tween 20 after the fact and with some mixing and/or sonication, resuspend the stearic acid mixture. Even if you are forming micelles, it should be solid already and avoid the issue. But it might not form the right size particles or resist resuspension. Who knows? Concentration is still probably the best bet.",Chemistry

Now, if you see a recording and find that B changes to A in X time, you know that recording is played backward in time.  You have just broken time-symmetry since you can determine if the recording is played forward or backward in time. \n\nOf course, as others mentioned.  The overall system has to preserve CPT-symmetry.  In this case, when playing it backward in time, you do not reverse either the charge (C) or the parity (P).",Physics

"Yeah, that‚Äôs what I was mainly talking about too. Did you read my post past the first example? It applies about the same for flue streams as it does to atmospheric CO2, which is why I brought it up. The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn‚Äôt affect the energy required to capture it at all. \n\n(If you just feel like skimming the rest of this, see the paragraphs I say are the most important one. It provides links to journal articles which directly address what thermodynamic processes are important in determining the limits of direct air capture. One passage from one of the journal articles directly addresses and contradicts your claim.)\n\nDo you think that people who research carbon capture whether from coal/natural gas plants or from the atmosphere are just missing this very straightforward energy argument you‚Äôre making? Process chemistry analysis of the feasibility of carbon capture is done on all of these different capture environments. Have these people missed out on the apparent massive flaw in direct air capture? If you read such a paper, it even talks about energy requirements and related concerns for carbon capture. A conclusion you won‚Äôt find in this analysis is that ‚Äúcarbon capture is pointless because the energy required to capture the carbon is too high.‚Äù You can read this article (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2020.00092/full). Note the following quotation ‚ÄúBased on these studies, DAC is currently considered as an energy-intensive and costly approach for removing CO2 from the atmosphere. However, researchers believe that the high cost and energy consumption in such systems are mostly due to the immaturity of the technology, and hence DAC may be eventually considered as a viable option for removing CO2 from the atmosphere.‚Äù There‚Äôs no suggestion that DAC is futile because of thermodynamics restrictions. Perhaps you have a reservation about this journal (I know it‚Äôs maybe a little controversial - my main experience with it has been with a very high quality review article I read in it on a different topic though), in which case I‚Äôm sure you can find other articles on this topic in other journals, although the corresponding author‚Äôs google scholar looks legitimate enough. \n\n(These next 2 paragraphs are the most important part of my reply)\n\nYou can also check out (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00173) which is a very well cited review on direct air capture. They even have a thermodynamics section toward the end. Note that they even mention the second law of thermodynamics, but the process they are applying it to is CO2 binding to the adsorbent and then having it unbind. Citation 28 of that paper directly addresses a theoretical lower bound for the energy requirements in section 2.1. Here‚Äôs a link for a pdf of it. (https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00003926/document) The paragraphs at the start of section 2 explain how the relevant thermodynamic process doesn‚Äôt involve whatever it was that initially put the CO2 there, but rather have to do with adsorption and desorption from the material. Note how they don‚Äôt even mention the source of the CO2 in the atmosphere. \n\nThat article in citation 28 even has this quotation ‚ÄúThe ‚àº4 GJ/tC minimum may be compared to the carbon-specific energy content of fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas have about 40, 50, and 70 GJ/tC respectively. Thus if the energy for air capture is provided by fossil fuels then the amount of carbon captured from the air can‚Äîin principle‚Äîbe much larger than the carbon content of the fuel used to capture it. The fuel carbon can, of course, be captured as part of the process rather than being emitted to the air.‚Äù This directly shows that your claim is incorrect. \n\nI‚Äôm not trying to be argumentative for its own sake; your claim sounded intuitive enough that I figured people might read it, think it sounded right, and then move on with a very misinformed opinion on direct air capture. In another thread on this subreddit I even saw a similar claim to the one you made being made, so it seems like others find this type of argument compelling, but I‚Äôm not sure where it‚Äôs coming from. \n\nRegarding your other point, I don‚Äôt understand why the main thing you responded to had to do with the greenhouse effect either. Obviously CO2 is a greenhouse gas. My point was that the CO2 that gets captured may or may not be in an excited vibrational state when it gets captured. Ultimately, it doesn‚Äôt even matter for the rest of the argument though. The 2 main paragraphs above show that your thermodynamic argument is incorrect with peer-reviewed journal articles.",Physics

So even in your current 3D world you see a 2D representation of it. In a 4D world you would also see a 2D slice.\n\nNow imagine you live in a 2D world on a piece of paper, here your retina would be a line segment. If someone proposed adding a 3rd dimension in a simulation you'd need a way of rotating your field of view ""upwards"" so the line segment could receive information from out of the plane but you'd still only see in 1D. This upwards rotation would be an alien concept to you much like the operation needed to go from 3D to 4D is to us. \n\nHaving said that, yes I think you could define some operation that would allow you to move through a 4th dimension in a video game. What that would look like I have no idea. However, you would still be looking at a reduced representation of 4D space, you'd render 3 dimensions and then see that in 2D. \n\nThere's a few videos on YouTube of simple shapes in 4D, try searching 4D simulation.

"I can't remember what I was watching, probably something on youtube, but they talked about the generic cost breakdown and building schedule of say a nuclear power plant vs something much cheaper and more plentiful like a natural gas power plant.\n\nThe breakdown was while a nuclear produces more power and had something of a lower overhead cost, the nuclear power plant took something like 6 years to start and end construction whereas natural gas was 2 i think. And on top of that nuclear took a couple more years after finish to start paying back the cost of the loan, while natural made consistent payments on a much quicker timeline.\n\nLastly is the short sightedness of politics. Investing in long term solutions can have negative impacts on someone's public view if it looks like nothing is happening.

"I found this on the World Wide Web:\n\nNo shape can ‚Äúamplify‚Äù sound.\n\nSound being a pressure wave in air, it has a fixed energy, which dissipates with distance from the source.\n\nIf you want to maximise the amount of that energy you capture, a parabolic dish can focus that energy down to a point, which has the effect of concentrating it there. The bigger the dish, the more energy it can redirect.\n\nIn reverse, a parabolic reflector can also create a ‚Äúbeam‚Äù of sound from a point source. This is not amplification, but it does optimise the energy that is there in a particular direction.\n\nAnother aspect is the efficiency of acoustic coupling. A vibrating membrane might have a certain power, but if it‚Äôs coupled poorly to the air, it won‚Äôt produce much sound. Certain shapes can vastly improve this efficiency. It does not ‚Äúamplify‚Äù, but it does make sure that what energy is there is transferred to the air efficiently. This is the purpose of horns such as on acoustic gramophone players, brass musical instruments, PA speakers, etc. The best shape is an exponential horn that forms a smooth impedance match between the original source of vibration and the air. Horns work either way around - as a receiver, the human ear is somewhat like a horn; many animals have very obviously horn-shaped ears which acts as a combined horn + parabolic reflector.\n\nby Graham Cox, BSc (hons) from University of East Anglia (1993)",Physics

That is to say, there is no such thing as the temperature of a single atom, nor the pressure of a single atom, but rather these macroscopic properties (of a gas, say) can be very accurately modeled as emerging from the many trillions of well-understood kinetic collisions of those atoms. In this metaphor, there is no such thing as a consciousness particle or consciousness field but rather it emerges when you reach some critical threshold of interacting neurons.\n\nHe also uses some subtle arguments relating to the trade offs between a given force (gravity, EM) and its reach of influence. If a consciousness force could affect the brain, it would have to be certainly much stronger than gravity and we‚Äôve never detected such a force.\n\nI do agree this is likely beyond his field of expertise, but I don‚Äôt fault him (or anyone) for positing claims beyond their strict academic domain.",Biology

So you would need 0.01 uL. Agree? \n\nNot practical. So let's dilute the viruses.\n\nIf you diluted 1/10, they would be 1E8/uL. You would still need 0.1 uL. \n\nIf you diluted 1/100, they would be 1E7/uL, so you would need 1 uL.\n\n(Note those numbers are for spiking the whole 200 uL of cells at once. If that isn't what you want, you will need to do the numbers for your volumes.)\n\nTo dilute 1/100, you can do  that in one step, or do 1/10 twice. The math is the same. It's just up to you what volumes to handle.\n\nNote that what we are doing here is breaking things down to small steps. One thing at a time. Makes it easier to follow. And round numbers make it easier. Once you think you have a plan, give the actual numbers a final check. (And good to have someone there double-check.)\n\nDo you need to correct for the volume added? Depends how accurate you need to be. If you add 1 uL to 200 uL, probably not. If you added 100 uL, it would be a 1/3 correction. Easy enough in any case.",Biology

In the last line of the derivation, they assume the pressures outside the tank and at the top of the fluid column are both atmospheric, but that's not the case here. So what you want is the second-to-last equation, which contains both the contributions from the height of the tank, and from the pressure difference.\n\nAnd you can see how that varies as you change the position of the hole in the tank. If the pressure difference between inside and outside is dominant, then moving the hole up or down will have little effect on the flow velocity, and the velocity will be proportional to the square root of the pressure difference.",Physics

Liquids tend to compress and expand much less because theyre bound together better than gas.\n\nAir moving over a wing will decompress as it makes its journey longer than the journey of air underneath the wing. This fast, decompressed air pulls the winged object upwards, right? Water wont ""give"" in the same way, as i said most liquids are resistent to compression and decompression. I would say the shape of the wing will definitely alter the object's trajectory, but the mechanics behind it are different from in a gas, and i wouldnt call it ""lift"".",Physics

Then, it quickly redissolves and, the free Ag+ reacts with the Cl- that is in the sample to form AgCl. This salt has less solubility than the Ag2CrO4 so when more AgNO3 is added, more AgCl is formed until all the Cl- is consumed and only after that, Ag2CrO4 will be formed permanently.\n\nThe AgCl precipitate has a white color.

"As I learned from Carl Sagan, we can't comprehend 4D, but we can calculate it's ""shadow."" \n\nFor example, a creature in Flat Land that can only experience 2 dimensions will not be able to comprehend a cube, BUT, it CAN comprehend the SHADOW of the cube as projected onto its 2D world. From the creature's point of view, the object is not a collection of equal sides and angles, like a cube is supposed to be, but rather, the creature sees two differently sized squares linked together (just like a drawing of a cube).  \n\nLike the creature, we cannot see or comprehend a cube in the 4th dimension, but we can comprehend its shadow as projected onto our 3D world. A tesseract, as it's called, is simply a small cube centered within a larger cube with the vertices connected. From our perspective, the cubes are not equal sizes and the connection points are not equal to the sides of the squares, but regardless of our perception, it is a perfectly equilateral object in the 4th dimension, and each face is its own cube. We know this because, in order to create a 4th dimensional cube (tesseract), you would have to take 3D cubes and seperate them equally across a brand new direction, one that does not exist in our reality (just like ""up"" and ""down"" are brand new directions that do not exist in the reality of the Flat Worlder).\n\nMy point is, a virtual reality experience of the 4th dimension would still be grounded in the 3rd, because that's all we can experience. You're right in that we can calculate these 4th dimensional objects and possibly insert them into a virtual reality code, but all we would be able to see are the ""shadows"" of the objects, like the 3D representation of a tesseract.\n\nhttps://math.stackexchange.com/questions/55433/in-what-sense-is-a-tesseract-shown-4-dimensional",Physics

A 0% DILUTION of the stock solution would mean that you are not diluting it at all, correct? So 10 mL of stock, 0 mL water. I filled out the chart accordingly for the different dilutions. It then says to take those prepared dilutions and run them through the spectrophotometer. I did not work on that part, a lab partner did so ignore the light absorbance results, I just copied those down from them. Anyway, at the top of THAT table, it says CONCENTRATION of stock. There, the 0 says H2O only, as if it were a 0% concentration of the stock, meaning a 100% DILUTION. Does anyone else see how using the dilutions from the first table, does not seem to match the second table talking about concentrations? I'm losing my mind here.",Biology

"Here is a write-up I made some time back after I went through this and then had friends do so. Hope it helps!\n\nPantry moth (Indian meal moth): Plodia interpunctella. It is different from other meal moth species, including the common meal moth, Pyralis farinalis. Adults are tricolored above, wavy patterned below, and with the tiny abdomen tip held at about 90 degrees to body plane. Now pantropical (and in warm temperate regions), it may have originated in Central America.\n\nTheir diet is unusually broad, including grains and many foods made with at least some grain including cereals, breads, muffins, pasta, pet food, bird seed, but apparently also some nuts, candy bars, peanut butter, possibly starches such as corn starch, tapioca, etc.\n\nThe peak adult activity is around dusk. During daytime the adults mostly remain inactive in dark spots (e.g. crevices). Adults are moderately attracted to light, especially in the blue to violet range.\n\nThey are readily detectable using pheremone traps (scented tent-traps). Deter them by using airtight, adequate  food containers or double bagging, as well as using essential oils and nontoxic pantry moth spray. All stages including eggs are readily killed in a short time by temperatures over c. 130¬∞F (e.g. in a car in the sun on a hot day) or freezing for 72 hours.\n\nUnlike most meal moths, the larvae of this species readily chew through paper, some plastics including processed-cereal freshness liners, and even thin cardboard. Double-bagging with Ziplock bags is normally adequate unless populations are large. Tupperware style containers only work if they completely seal (""airtight""). Put open food away promptly and avoid leaving pet food out more than a day or two.\n\nEdit: typos",Biology

This *usually* does not produce a well-rounded, coherent theory with a multitude of new predictions that fits neatly into all observed models (for a converse example, see general relativity, which did this perfectly). \n\nA solution to the horizon problem which I *wouldn't* consider ""hack-ish"" is one that has some kind of underlying conceptual impetus for *why* another ad-hoc scalar quantum field is a sensible addition to our universal framework, akin to *why* space-time is a sensible view of the universe. This is admittedly phiosophical, and I am not suggesting that inflaton fields or the higgs boson are bad physics - obviously they are far from it.

">The fundamental point is that when it comes to capturing carbon, the way the CO2 was generated doesn‚Äôt affect the energy required to capture it at all.\n\nIf you mean:  the amount of energy required to re-uptake the CO2 from the atmosphere has no relation to the energy that was spent in releasing and mixing the CO2 into the atmosphere, then you're very simply wrong about this.   \n\nWhether any and all of this is done by burning fossil fuels (to generate the problem) and running renewably powered CO2-harvesters (to fix it) such as the prototype in Iceland, OR by decomposing plant and animal matter over thousands of years (the problem) and growing plants and algae (the fix) -- regardless of the ""implementation"" of the process, man-made or natural, it is absolutely the case that when you mix the CO2 into the atmosphere, \_energy is spent\_.  And if that CO2 is taken back, energy is spent again, and the amount on this ""uptake"" is \_necessarily at least as much as on the first mixing\_ --- *in practice*, it's a lot more.   This is very straightforward thermodynamics -- it's why and how a perpetual motion machine is impossible.  \n\nPerhaps I've mislead you by letting out, early on, an air that this relation between the energies is somehow 1-to-1, when it's not -- for example, when you burn a log, depending on your furnace etc, ""only"" about 15-30% of the energy released by the burn goes into heating the exhaust flue (and is thereby a component of the ""issue with entropy"" that the fart was originally about).  If I let the impression that 100% does, then it's my mistake.  HOWEVER, the energetics and thermodynamics of releasing that exhaust into the atmosphere is *still* such that I say confidently: you would have to use \_at least\_ the energy equivalent to that of burning the original log to get the exhaust back.  Whether this is done by just letting the winds blow over your adsorbant for 100 000 years, or by the flora growing for a 10 000, or by some array of turbines circling the planet and run by solar power for a thousand --- doesn't matter at all.  The fact remains that to reverse an irreversible process, you'll be spending at least the same amount of energy (and in practice, usually, much, much more). \n\nThere are many things that go into that confidence, understanding of the laws of thermodynamic being one, the ""sadly"" minute concentration of CO2 another (it would be much, much easier to process the N2 of our atmosphere, for example) -- we can even get to those if you like, but we simply *must* get around the *same* table before its even worthwhile.  As of now, you've written walls, I've said things, but we haven't been even discussing the same thing really.  \n\n\nI will read the rest of your comment, too :)",Physics

"Hey man, not sure why people are up in arms if this is truly not for a grade, which I hope it is not. OH proton signals are typically funky and broad because they exchange with solvent (they are somewhat acidic), so that statement is telling you the singlet belongs to the OH proton. The small signal at 78 ppm in the C NMR is from solvent if it was run in a chlorinated solvent, otherwise it may be from your analyte (what would make a C appear at higher ppm?) So now you can use the MW along with the fact you have a Cl and O to play around with some structures which match your H and C NMR.\n\nEdit: I'm certain the small peak in the C NMR is solvent, so ignore it. You should have been told the solvent it was run in. CDCl3 shows up around 77 ppm on C NMR.",Chemistry

"I‚Äôd say the reactivity series and how more reactive things can ‚Äòsteal‚Äô atoms from other compounds. This is quite an easy and fun one to demonstrate, look up thermite. Be very careful, this is dangerous. If you want to start simple and safe(ish), get 3 things, copper wire, steel wool and magnesium ribbon. Heat the copper to red hot with a lighter, blowtorch etc. It might melt a bit and once you take it off heat, it will go black. This is copper oxide forming. Next, burn the steel wool, this will self sustain the reaction, but nothing extremely violent. Finally, light the magnesium ribbon and see how violent the reaction is in comparison to the others.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this is the best place to start because it can be demonstrated with ease and it explains why reactions happen, like iron rusting in the presence of water.\n\nI‚Äôd recommend watching YouTube videos that interest you, especially those from periodic videos, Nile red, Nurd rage, Grant thompson(the king of random 4 years ago) and Cody‚Äôs lab",Chemistry

"I can attest from personal experience it is impossible to ride with more than a small amount of weight. I'm sure many a child has figured out the hard way that letting go of the handlebars while an external force is acting on them (such as wind, a bag of groceries, or a dog leash) is an extremely bad idea. The precise effect depends on the bicycle geometry - the fork angle, wheel offset, handlebar width, handle bar offset from the axis of steering, the rider's weight and position. For example shorter handlebar offsets causes lateral loads to contribute more to leaning the bike, whereas longer offsets causes the load to produce more steer and offset the weight from the steering axis considerably. The tire's trail affects how the bike handles at a given steer and lean angle. Most of the time though, the slackened steering produces a reversed castor wheel effect, a bag of groceries on one side will mostly tend to just steer very severely that direction in an attempt to reach the local minima of the slanted steering axis. Depending on the exact geometry, skill, weight, etc it's possible to just no-hands around in a circle with a weight on one bar, where the steering force is counteracted by the centripetal normal force, as that weight is directly analogous to a rider applying the same load with their hands to enter a turn, however this represents a singular self-stable state. If the bag is swinging around dramatically from the unsteadiness it would produce, you now have this crazy double-pendulum chaotic system. The question gets more interesting when you add a dog leash to the equation, as the force can now act along angles that the bike was not designed to self-stabilize against. The leash can be pulling out of a turn while the bike is attempting to steer into it which can cause sudden inversions in the force vectors along an unexpected axis, leading to undesireable behavior such as the wheel suddenly being oversteered, or the bike leaning out of a turn while steering into it. One can easily experiment with this unusual dynamic system with just two bikes - by riding one and pushing another beside yourself by the handlebars, you can feel how changing the position of your hand on the bar changes how the driving, slowing, banking, and steering forces all get mixed up.",Physics
