      "Biology is the study of life, there are plenty things to life that don’t involve the micro world. I know pornhub has videos on this. Sadly I was lied to and no pie was even made in the video I watched but a baby was made that doesnt look like a blood infection tho op should still see a doctor Great analysis. You’ve just made this thing sound way more scary. That is so sad!! We assume that it is an emergent property of the nervous system.  As a psychiatrist— I find that definition limits us to a mind body separation which is a fairly outdated and binary concept. The error rate depends on the technology used. Typically more than one technology are used to fill in gaps for whole genome sequencing, while highly accurate technologies are used for shorter sequences (ie: individual genes). CRIPSR isn’t (to my knowledge) being used all that much to look at identifying the underlying genetic causes of disorders, but rather fixing them on a molecular level. However, the studies that do this generally use CRISPR-mediated gene knockout/knockdown experiments. Looks like baby gator skull…. Eyes do seem a bit large though Oh thanks! I just like bugs, this isn’t my branch of study or anything. \\n\\nBut I’ve been talking to people who do study Entomology and they’re saying it’s unlikely a young adult. Virologist here. Your child is not vaxxed, but temporarily protected. Your wife's breast milk should have antibodies from her being recently vaccinated, and those antibodies can be ingested by your child and provide temporary immunity. However, once your wife's antibody surge returns to normal levels, the temporary immunity won't be as potent. Only through vaccination can your child be protected in the long term. I hope this makes sense! I don’t know but you’re a braver man than I. I agree. The emended genus definition for *Pectinatus* (Juvonen and Suihko 2006) is consistent with OP's morphology (included below for interest). It looks like this genus contains both catalase-positive and catalase negative species. It's worth noting that the agar that OP used (NBB-A) states in the user manual that it is \"Nutrient media for the detection of Beer-spoiling microorganisms (esp. Lactobacilli, Pediococci, *Pectinatus* and *Megasphaera*) in filtered beer samples.\"\\n>*Pectinatus* [Pec.ti.na′tus. L. part. adj. *pectinatus* combed (bacteria)].\\n\\n>Cells are non-spore-forming, slightly curved to helical rods, 0·4–0·9×2–50 μm or more, with rounded ends and a Gram-negative cell wall. They occur singly, in pairs or rarely in short chains. Cells are usually motile by means of comb-like flagellation which emanates from only one side of a cell. Cadaverine or putrescine is found in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. Organisms are strictly anaerobic mesophiles with fermentative metabolism. Glucose and fructose are mainly metabolized to acetic and propionic acids. H2S and acetoin and occasionally minor amounts of succinic acid are produced. Cells do not synthesize cytochrome oxidase, desulfoviridin or indole, hydrolyse arginine or gelatin or reduce nitrate. The G+C content of the DNA is 38–41 mol%. The species of the genus can be separated from each other by using various genetic and phenotypic criteria. Isolated from beer and brewing processes. The type species is *Pectinatus cerevisiiphilus* Lee et al. 1978 emend. Schleifer et al. 1990. Sure, but have you been to Orinda? You have to throw out all of your fun before going into town. thanks bro!! Yes, because the smoke is absorbed into the blood streams hence finds its way to both brains. OP, I saw your other posts.\\n\\nWhaddya been smokin' brah?\\n\\nIt's a question btw, and not rhetorical; I really wanna know... It's the same guy posting this crap. Mods don't do anything Viruses are quite complex because they are ever changing forms... Looks like a conure Got it. Thank youu! Perhaps you are not a Disney princess after all Maybe enough to illuminate a workspace for a night-light sort of situation, but they'll never be able to emit more light than they have to absorb. All of the energy they emit would have to be photosynthesized from other light sources. That’s a June bug I finished undergrad with a BS Biology and BA Chemistry. I tried to find a biology job for a few months with no success, then tried for chemisty and  I could immediately find work in chemistry.  After a year I went to grad school and finished a Ph.D. Environmental Sciences and Resources: Biology, throughout which my chemistry background was very useful.  For almost 22 years I've been working in biotech, designing antisense oligos, assisting customers with experimental design, designing new products, contributing to marketing and advertising, and troubleshooting production processes.  The chemistry background has been an invaluable foundation for my mostly-biological career.  You can go usually go farther faster with a chemistry background; I suggest you consider the science double major, adding a minor if you wish (I minored professional writing). It may also be a young teneral adult. They can’t do much until they toughen up a bit. The OP paragraph asked if viral RNA or inactivated virus can be passed through breast milk I honestly don't know, but some of the subreddits you subscribe to that may pertain to sexual orientations or lack thereof may not be something you want a perspective interviewer to be able to look up and consider, especially since it's not germane to the interview. But you are putting it out there.\\n\\n TL|DR Prospective employers may read your Reddit profile and your online posts; your history might not always help you get a job. \\n\\nI'm still not telling you what to do - - just sharing thoughts.\\n\\nCheers,\\nBobH Also I’m not trying to win this argument I see what you’re saying after I re read your comment. It’s because this is new, and killing people I get that that’s why it’s being publicized. But, still heart disease has been here for how long and no one seems to care about that for the well being of the public. It’s bread. Wild bread. What a treat. Return that abomination to the primordial hellscape from whence it came. the first picture is from last month, thankfully it’s completely gone now and i am only left with orange bumps which are worrying me sick Nothing fun-my-gi? I live in WC and we have all sorts of cool shit (for California!) The bug posts are so annoying. Isn't there a sub for insects and random species identification? And the bite hurts like hell. 1. I don't know much about sublingual liquid forumulations, but I believe that the active ingredient would need to either already be in solution or be delivered as a micronized powder in suspension. In the latter case, the smaller particles would presumably dissolve readily.\\n2. The vitamins you refer to are not \"attached\" to the excipients, they are \"aggregated\" together which is a physical phenomenon. Think of the vitamin as a marble being placed in a cup with smaller beads (the excipient), then add some flour and water and the resulting clump is analogous how the drug is formulated. That said, yes, the vitamin will release from the clump and enter the bloodstream.\\n3. I don't understand your third question. A nebulizer works by converting a liquid or suspension containing the vitamin into a fine mist which is inhaled into the lungs. If it's a suspension, the particulates are extremely fine and when deposited in the lungs, allow the vitamin to cross the alveolar and fine bronchial membranes into surrounding tissues and the bloodstream. Where was the hive at? And then there’s ignorance without compassion. Thanks for reminding me. i though it was neapolitan with no chocolate part for a second b4 i read the title 🤢 Looks like an Aminta, so yes :) Beautiful mysterious creatures.. unfortunately it is probably at the end of the life cycle, thanks for trying to help tho, we need more people like you in the world ❤️ Why does it feel like I'm doing your homework?  For your body to use them it needs to be broken down to individual atoms or molecules not particles.  You are probably better off posting to r/Chemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against.  You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another.  The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible.  That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur.  It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process.  Molecules be they vitamins, drugs, or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting.  Therefore said interactions aren't going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules.  Again at this point you are really talking chemistry more than biology. As for PH levels affecting absorption rates yes it plays a huge role but again this will be dependent upon the vitamin in question. Yennifer is the only crow that's beautiful to me Literally everywhere! It's a pastime of ours! You can't see viruses in a light microscope. They're smaller than half the wavelength of visible light, which is the lower limit.\\n\\nYou need something with a higher resolution like an electron microscope, a scanning tunneling microscope or an atomic force microscope.\\n\\nAnd most fungus has a very distinct growing pattern.\\n\\nAs for the yeast in beer, that also looks very specific. Road maintenance workers would no longer need to wear reflective vests I had those too, they lay eggs in food, don't know the exact name but they also infest open bags of wheat,  cornflakes, nuts, dry food etc. You'll see their webs, the tiny maggots create those. Also they nested behind old wooden furniture and under a rubber matting which was connecting the kitchen with the next room, we found lots of cocoons under there as we were moving in. Success was showing only after cleaning out the hotspots and starting to clip and close all food bags very tightly. Sadly we had to throw out lots of food in the process. We couldn't afford throwing out the entire kitchen furniture, just for the floor atm, some traps for these kind of moths were enough for now. Hope this helps. It shouldn't be that hard to grasp that a sudden gain of function mutation was advantageous for the virus. It already happened 10 and 20 years ago with MERS and SARS epidemics. until you scoop em out of your house by the thousands. Okay that sucks but did you die? Did joe Rogan die? I don’t want to get sick but if I do whatever I won’t die from it. Part of me is convinced consciousness is a term that we invented, but doesn’t necessarily have a singular physical counterpart in reality.\\n\\nIt’s an emergent property of sufficiently complex intercommunicating systems.\\n\\nAnts in a colony behave a lot like individual neurons and as a result, the hive behaves like a larger, single organism. Seriously. I don’t even mind so much when they’re funny. This just smacks of sadness lol After reading about its prey, I’m warming up to this little monster. This post was brought to you by VINEGAR!  IT CLEANS GOOD. Because white people problems. Amanita.... Don't eat it.... They are poisonous.... Let me summarize what I have just read on the CDC website:  they say \" don't take it beforehand to try to pre-empt pain from the vaccine\". they also say \"It is OK to get the vaccine if you have taken it beforehand\".  and \"It is ok to take it after getting the vaccine\".  If you have a study indicating that there is a decline in covid vaccine efficacy based on pre-vaccination NSAID use, please provide it. Explain how it seems like that? >**Would one of the twins be jerking off the other?**\\n\\nThis line of scientific research definitely deserves more long-term funding.\\n\\nScience should leave no such stone unturned.\\n\\nFinding answers to these pressing questions is merely a matter of time, Captain.\\n\\n. If the box had a beautiful bunch of ripe bananas then my guess is that's a black tarantula. I agree. Well put. It's also found in packaged beer Digging deeper, if each conjoined twin controls one arm.  Would one of the twins be jerking off the other?  Or if one twin was tired, could the other one take over? So I'm bad at making notes and cue cards so what works for me is learning the work then using quizlet and easy notes. I find going through about 5-6 different people's cue cards are usually enough to cover the topics properly\\n\\nAnother method I find works is the active recall method. This works by writing notes (or using someone else's if you're bad at making notes like I am). After you write your notes rewrite the notes leaving out important words and topics. When studying use both sets to Study. Then use the set with the missing words to revise Despite having 6 legs, dragonflies can't walk or use them to move. Their legs are for capturing prey in flight and clean some body parts. Why would we? There's no medical practitioners in nature. Best you can do is deal with the immediate symptoms. There's no evolutionary pressure for the body to develop a system that identifies everything that can possibly be infecting you. The body deals with itself. What purpose would telling you that you have a stomach bug serve? You're already throwing up and that's the best response you're going to get in nature. KILL IT, KILL IT NOW!!! Bacteria don't have nuclei and are living. Definition of living includes multiple parts including obtain/use energy and reproduction.  Viruses aren't considered living because they can't reproduce on their own. \\n\\nMinimum number of atoms would be however many are needed to form the smallest unicellular organism. Why did you touch it? wE jUsT dOn'T kNoW yup, you get my vote I've been unable to work because of this so I pretty much been obsessing 24/7 for the last 6 months I've learned quite a bit. I sent you a link if you want to join that group if you haven't yet I can give you some info I know... Certainly no cure but it's starting to definitely get acceptance by some high people. It's hard for them to deny it now. A couple of places are taking blood doing some research on it. \\n\\nI too have the brain fog issue it's really severe. I'd like to say it's been a little better recently though. But yeah it's very frustrating people tell you you sound normal but I feel dosed with drugs and forget things too it's a short-term memory loss problem it seems. I did the Columbia University intake survey for post vaccines syndrome the questions are designed for covid but they are taking both. The questions being designed for covid we're really telling because basically I answered yes to all of them but it's from the vaccine.\\n\\nThere is no doubt there is crossover. I guess the spike protein must be the catalyst for everything No one is saying you have to or forcing you to. However it’s like driving on the sidewalk, there is nothing stopping you; physically, but you know you shouldn’t because of laws. But if you did you’d lose your license. Kids can’t go to school unless they are vaccinated against a whole bunch of things, yet this is somehow different because of reasons that are constantly disproven. \\n\\nYou should, to mitigate the risk of passing it on to another who isn’t as healthy and lucky as you are. A mobile smoothie blender with built in straw,- got it lol We’re unique in that we can build adaptations for different environments. Without these tools, we can swim, but a lot of animals can swim but aren’t considered semi-aquatic. Right? 1)  You’d also need remnants of the integrase that enables reverse-transcribed DNA to be integrated into the genome.\\n\\n2)  Your cells are all currently chock-full of mRNA molecules.  If reverse transcriptase randomly copied and integrated any mRNA hanging around, it would be integrating gajillion of pieces of your normal mRNA into your genome, which would be really bad for your cells.  The integrating mechanisms of viruses are often focused on both reverse transcribing and integrating their own DNA *specifically*.\\n\\n3)  If it did, all that would mean is that the cell is basically like a cell infected with real COVID (well, a part of it).  And how do you fight off cells with COVID?  Your immune system!  The cell would continue to make spike proteins, and the whole way the immune response works is by detecting cells that are making unfamiliar proteins, like the spike protein, and then killing them.  Basically, your body would kill those cells just like it would fight off any and all normal infections. Because you’re not allowed to have anything negative to say about the vaccine on any public forum anymore. I think it's a Polydrusus formosus. Super cute! This has a bit of a sociological side to it but you could write about the hostile political climate that views science experts as elitists thus stifling progress You gave him the UGLY! -P. star This helped my 5yo a lot. Not being condescending. It helped a lot of adults too. https://youtu.be/1gBZVkQIniM You can by 10% neutral buffered formalin on Amazon. If you go this route, be sure to read the SDS which provides you safety precautions, storage instructions, disposal concerns. Compounds like this cannot be just dumped down the drain. \\n\\nTypically after 24 hours in NBF, samples are transferred to a “wash solutions” which is usually PBS. You’re not going to have that offhand, but given that this is way more for a keep-sake than any meaningful molecular work homemade saline works fine. \\n\\nAn important note, you don’t want to use typical preservatives as they often pose incredibly high risks to the users. An example being sodium azide, which is commonly used for fixed tissue prep. \\n\\nYou can pretty readily find preservatives available for home-made cosmetics. In most cases, those preservatives are likely sufficient, and I’d use them at a similar (or **slightly** higher) loading. It can also be stored in alcohol (isopropanol or ethanol both work) as noted by a different commenter. \\n\\nYou’re at an advantage, because you’re not collecting data from these tissues, you can use techniques that are “harsher” on the tissue while maintaining its structure because all you care about here is the anatomy. This means that techniques that alter histological data and biochemical data while maintaining morphology actually will work for you, because you don’t care about the former two. \\n\\nAn unconventional and incredibly inconvenient solution, solutions of glycerin that are at least 70% glycerin are actually preservatives\\n\\nPSA: these organs weren’t perfused, so fixed and clotted blood is gonna kinda riddle the tissue. I’m not entirely sure the aesthetics of it, but it will make it much harder to visualize the finer details of the structure. \\n\\nIf you’re storing the organs in a liquids remember to rinse it prior to any handling, and only handle with the appropriate gloves (best bet nitrile) Hmm…..but wouldn’t plastic production also release toxic byproducts more than lumber? It’s the souls from your enemies Looks like a naughty spider to me \"There are no lethal poisons, only lethal doses\". The only certainty in life is death There are hundreds of viruses that can cause common cold symptoms. Being immune to one does not guarantee immunity to another. Yup!  It’s r/whatsthisbug [Here's another article](https://www.loc.gov/everyday-mysteries/item/how-do-spiders-avoid-getting-tangled-in-their-own-webs/) and [one more article](https://www.livescience.com/8934-scientists-untangled-spider-web-stickiness.html). I don't think a lot of research has been done on this. Sorry bro I work with Salmonella enterica so I got no clue His views are scientifically valid. Just like those anti Vax.....They dont know truth is truth and like to argue because they \"don't know what's inside\". Green color is a dominant trait and yellow are recessive. So basically GG, Gy will be green (punnets square) and yy will be yellow. \\n\\nTest conclusions by actively cross pollination experiments and the length is how long it takes for pea plants to fruit. Matlab, R, Python, Javascript Not today Satan. Every kind of joint I'm the director of an interventional cardiology program at a hospital in central Texas that includes overseeing the operation of a couple of cardiac cath labs. What is the home repair subreddit? Not together though. Consider Geographic Information Science. I majored in Biology and got a minor in chemistry and marine biology. I went back later and got a GIS degree.\\n\\nI think data science is a good idea too. Another idea would be writing or technical writing if you are interested in that. We definitely would be better off if SOME humans couldn’t reproduce at all.

Should be dark violet brown to dark tobacco brown. 0, there’s is a 0% chance that you will catch covid, surface infection is relatively low, and if you disinfected things you probably eliminated the small chance you had of contracting it, also the placement of where you touched means you’ve even less chance because since you didn’t touch your eye you touched above it as long as that skin was intact, no cuts or broken skin then you all good  friend don’t let the health anxiety get you too worried And also the enantiomer? https://honest-food.net/eating-santas-shroom/ Well maybe I qualify. My lab uses bioinformatics to understand deep evolution and major transitions (Last Universal Common Ancestor, Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor, symbiont to organelle transitions, etc, etc)  We have various distance measures for genomes, rRNAs, protein sequences, and protein folds. We develop algorithms for finding homology and divergence. Naturally we have very specific mathematical criteria that we use to define homology - homology is how we detect ancestry. This is the thing - the concept of species and the definition of species is just not useful to us. It is just not something that comes up, ever. If we needed a definition of species we would invent one, but we don't need it, so we have not invented it.\\nI suppose in agricultural sciences or somewhere  like that there might be an operation definition, but that is probably not going to apply to the universal tree of life. Just a little boy Draw it then speak it out loud, pretending to teach it to someone (or actively teach it to someone, a pet or even a pencil). Repeat this.

I sent the mods a request, as others probably have. One issue I realized is that those posts did not specifically violate one of the criteria for reporting, and r/biology doesn't have any rules itself. Yes wheel bugs are definitely beneficial insects that only bite humans as a last resort in self defense. They kill pest insects by the creepy mouth strawful especially Japanese beetles, aphids and gypsy moth and tent caterpillars. They are out in force right now in Virginia! That horrible girl did it , left me hanging not knowing cause u know women dont like to text back if u r insecure It should be referring to the solute concentration after dilution, refer to the second paragraph on the sheet. Buddy it is okay if you have low IQ I think the word you're looking for is altruism, and act of compassion towards another unrelated organism with little to no regard for the risk to oneself or compensation of such an act. In humans it is evident, although there is an ongoing debate on whether an act can be truly altruistic given that, on a subconscious level, it is almost exclusively beneficial to be compassionate towards others, that is in most circumstances being kind to others earns us positive endorphins, a feeling of satisfaction when you help someone you don't know, which is the pinnacle of evolution in social animals. We are hard wired to sacrifice for others due to the parent-offspring bond which is so strong it extends to other potentially unrelated people and even other species. The same can be said for cetaceans, which are not far behind us in terms of social evolution. Although they may not be aware, or even capable of being aware of a potential payoff for helping a distressed swimmer at their own risk (although they likely do have these cognitive capabilites, at least where it concerns helping unrelated members of their own species), their social cognition is also hard wired to aid conspecifics and other creatures (humans, seals, other whales) based on their cognitively advanced awareness of present danger and the panicked behaviour of the organism in distress. Again, the payoff is positive endorphins rather than, let's say, the abstract idea of \"I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine\". I'm not sure this meta study has been done, but I would hypothesise that the greater sociality of a species, the greater frequency of acts deemed to be altruistic will be seen in that species, which simply means the more social an animal is, the more it will behave in a selfless manner towards non-related organisms. But again, there is a reward whether you're aware of it or not, that being positive endorphins. One is certainly aware of the positive effect these endorphins have on the body and mind, and being aware of this benefit thus calls into question the \"selfless\" nature of putting yourself at risk for others. It's much like that episode in friends when Phoebe let's a bee sting her. I hope that attempts to answer your question. Ask Mike Tyson yourself!

So if understand correctly, the organism has a \"reserve\" of stem cells which can multiply indefinitely without Hayflick limit. The rest of the cells in our body has a limited number of divisions possible starting from the moment they differentiate from the stem cell. New generations will be constantly renewed from the stem cell \"reserve\". Is my understanding correct?

Firstly university, studying biology, second i never said that you or anyone should eat, i just said it can technically be considered a magic mushroom although it is not psychedelic. Also there are more deaths from alcohol then from that mushroom, but you still shouldn't do it, and the the cultures that do it aren't like primitive island cultures but rather northern Europe and Asia like Finland or Russia and Lithuania, although the practice has been mostly forgotten. And this isn't something I've just heard or like it's probably in your case your grandma said to stay clear of that mushroom, you can look it up in the Wikipedia ( even tho yes Wikipedia isn't the most thrust worthy source) or some scientific articles, and as I said I know people who have taken the on several occasions whit out consequences, but I still wouldn't recommend it, just stating facts. Also anyone knows that if you boil that mushroom all the toxins dissolve in the water and you can just eat it for nutrients, but it isn't considered particularly tasty that's why novone really does that That’s probably the flapper disintegrated from chlorine. Either your municipal water is heavily chlorinated, or you put a toilet tank cleaning tablet (or something similar) in the tank I used the Seek app and it identified this as a Wheel Bug Ice cream, get yourself a scoop!

Listeria is a hell of a lot more common though I believe it is some form of coli I wouldn’t drink it Great series, but any of the benefits they mention in the show by the actions they took as a species would have pretty much the opposite effect, which is an incredibly detrimental result. This is presuming evolution works similarly with them, which seems probable, as the universe is a flux of order and chaos - and life thrives by evolving checks against entropy - Deleterious genes that would be expressed through inbreeding and civilizational destruction brought about by social collapse (everybody is a target, nobody can truly trust each other, or groups are highly fractionalized.

I’m just trying to get you to see the inconsistencies in your thought processes. Well the living/unliving status of viruses is still up for debate but that's for another thread. But in any case, evolutionary processes are not guided by \"want\" or any kind of volition. It is simply that the more effective at its strategy a virus is, the more descendants it will produce, which will carry its genetic material etc. This is also true for our evolution or that of plants and amoeba.\\nAlso, I'll point out that viruses \"tend\" to evolve towards a more commensal relationship with the host, with a decrease of virulence, where the virus won't kill it or harm it too much. But I believe its a tendency and not a rule though.\\nHope that helps, feel free to ask questions! Cursed Banana slices It will work, for sure. Lowes or Home Depot sells a new flapper plug for like 2$. Everyone says it’s mold or whatever but just looks like the plastic was eaten away and is disintegrating to me.

Let him chill in your garden he’s getting ready to pass. She poses for me every day Dinosaur, more like dinoNOOO There's a couple of reasons, first the common cold isn't a single virus, it's not even a single family of viruses so having immunity to one causal virus just reduces the number of common cold causing viruses that can infect you.  Another is that not all viruses are remembered equally.  Corona viruses in particular is one the body had poor memory for and your immunity will generally wane within 6 to 9 months of infection, just in time to pick it up again the next winter.  This is why those in high risk categories are getting booster shots for Covid 19 to boost that waning immunity.  Third is mutation, this is seen with the influenza virus most notably, hence the yearly flu vaccine where educated guesses are made to try and predict how it will mutate and then produce new vaccines on that prediction.  Fourth would be you're immune system is compromised, perhaps you were recovering from a severe illness or on immuno-suppressant or had viral infection, like measles, which wipes out your immune memory. Nice try As humans we're a bit used to thinking of childhood as a brief period and adulthood as long, but for most insects it's the other way around. Your dragonfly friend was a larva living underwater somewhere, snacking on bugs and small fish and tadpoles and growing bigger, for as long as a year or more. Its adult phase, when it had wings and flew around and made babies, was just the final few months.\\n\\nThanks for caring about bugs!

Yep. Happened all the time growing up in Minnesota. The brain, being a physical entity, is a deterministic system. Hate to break it to you, but until there's some massive physics breakthrough, Carroll is correct. \\n\\nWe don't need to know where in the brain consciousness \"originates\", just how the nervous system generally functions, which we do. It's just a bunch of electrochemical gradients and stochastically produced circuits. Both are physical processes, and again, are deterministic.

Forbidden ice cream It’s hard to say because it depends on what type of plastic the bags were made of. Other ingredients include various kinds of alcohols - methanol, ethanol, propanol - we encounter these in everyday life. They all have noticeable odours; but in low concentration the vapour isn’t something to worry about. Ethanol is the alcohol we find in wine, beer and spirits, the other alcohols are not something you should drink. Propanol is in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer. Methanol is used in fuel - but methanol is poisonous. You can find it in ‘moonshine’, that home made illicit booze. Drinking it is very risky (blindness, even death). But a faint smell of methanol is not really something to worry about. If you look at page 10 of that safety data sheet, it shows the toxic limits, but it takes some interpretation. Napthalene is toxic at 250ppm (parts per million, less than the other ingredients) but napthalene is what they make mothballs out of, and people happily put them in clothes closets for decades. It’s not very volatile, but you can definitely smell it. If you’ve thrown it all away, that’s OK. If you have clothing that’s come into contact with it, or you can smell it on that clothing, just wash that clothing. Some of the chemicals in the list are the same as those you smell in over-ripe fruit like bananas. Amyl acetate is used to make flavourings and scents. Most of these compounds won’t hurt you unless you breathe the vapours in high concentrations for long periods. Speaking for myself (and having worked in labs where we used chemicals like this) I wouldn’t be worried. Just ventilate - closet door wide open, window open - wash clothing that you detect a smell on and you should be OK.

III, right? Its our diaphram spasming. Its a muscle still and muscle spasms can happen. Wouldnt call that amphibian specidic trait but they also generally have muscle spasms You a biologist?, I wouldn't take your advice about something you never even tried. Life requires whatever minimum amount of atoms, configured in a certain shape, can use other molecules to reproduce itself/ build itself. Scientist do not yet know what the smallest amount of specifically shaped atoms ( complex molecule or molecules) are able to self-replicate. Many scientists believe that the premordial type of molecule was likely RNA.. very similar to DNA. The theory is called The RNA World Hypothesis. It was developed by the scientific mentors of Jennifer Doudna who recently won the Nobel Prize for CRISPR gene editing. She created a feasibly self replicating RNA consisting of a few thousand atoms, but it's unlikely this was or is the smallest amount of atoms that can self replicate. In short, still unknown. Regarding your question about concentration:\\n\\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here ([https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844](https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-concentration-605844)). It's easiest to understand \"the concentration of water in water\" using mass % or volume %. Two solutions of distilled water are each 100% water, so the concentration in each is just... 100%, by mass or volume. It might be a little counterintuitive because you're used to considering the concentration of something else, like salt or sugar, in water. But if two solutions are both pure water, then their concentration of water is the same.\\n\\nAs for your second point, I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school, and it tripped me up for a while too. The better way to understand diffusion is like this: there's no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration. Each molecule is moving completely randomly, bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors. It doesn't know what a \"concentration\" is, and it doesn't care. But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this:\\n\\n    A            |           B\\n     x  x x  x   |            \\n      x x x x x  |        x   \\n    x  xx  xx x  |\\n\\nWhich is more likely: that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B, or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A? Clearly, there are more Xs on side A, so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B. And we say that the solution diffuses into side B, though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly.\\n\\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other, they're still moving around just as fast, but now there's an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction. So we say our net diffusion is zero, even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate. > spirit of this sub,\\n\\nClassifications in Biology range from the extremely specific to the incredibly vague. For example, it could identify a young male Blue Tit as, well, that, *or* simply a member of the animal kingdom. Each name and group is derived from the group before it and could not exist without a predecessor.\\n\\nTherefore, if we do *not* have vague classifactions of nature, we have ignored what our specific names were built off of, we have disrespected the history and hard work of many a biologist before us.\\n\\nAs such, since many other subs have the specifics down on naming things better than us already, it should be up to us to give vague classifications for the very sake of biology. As long as we remain technically correct, we will have likely fulfilled this goal.\\n\\nSo it could be said (after jumping through many mental hoops) that it is in the spirit of this sub to be vague about this as long as the other ID subs exist.\\n\\nNot that anyone much cares, it seems. There a numerous examples of penguins taking same sex mates and bonding for at least a significant amount of time if not life. In other bird species as well I believe We already have gases that are designed to kill people, it doesn't have to be that complicated. So ignoring the considerable practical problems of engineering a nuclear reactor inside someone's stomach and converting the gains into biologically useful energy, funnily enough you picked iron (maybe on purpose and I'm getting next level whooshed?) which iirc is the only element that is always an energy loss whether put through nuclear fusion or fission. So unfortunately the dream of eating iron to survive is dead. >Sex is determined by the individuals reproductive organs.

You get a \"surge\", rapid increase, peak, whatever you want to call it to have it make sense to you (as a virologist, immunologist, entomologist, a new worried father, what have you), shortly after your immune system is stimulated. You would therefore after a vaccination \"booster\" get a \"surge\" or sudden increase in circulating antibodies. In this case for a booster it would be IgG antibodies over IgM, or even in this specific case of a pregnant/post-partum/breast-feeding mother IgA antibodies as it's present in her bodily fluids, but I digress.\\n\\nThen after a period of time the antibodies go down to almost undetectable levels. There's vast variations in the populations and within individuals, so saying that they go to \"0\" is not entirely accurate. In this day and age with there being no herd immunity, vaccine hesitation and resistance, etc., it's quite possible any particular person may have some level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies circulating at any point in time. That's why there's \"baseline\" with testing depending on the type of test done and what has been used as a control to establish that test. I've worked in a variety of laboratories and for instance, there's one influenza variant, let's call it variant A, that if your antibody titer is 1:8 or higher, you are considered immune to that virus (1 portion of your serum had enough antibodies present to bind to virus when mixed with blood and diluted at a ratio of 1:8). But let's also say there's another influenza variant, called B, that's a bit more funky, so we consider a titer of 1:16 or 1:32 protective. Or better yet, it's an H5-based influenza virus, in which case it's highly debated if HAI testing is even a good determinant of protective antibody response at all. But again, I digress.\\n\\nI hope this answered your question somewhat. Don’t worry, I’ll block you now. Umm yes. The damn squirrels throw acorns at me and the dog every time I take him for a walk.

He needs to understand that science isn't about what one person thinks (him, or one doctor, or one paper) -- it operates through consensus, and the consensus on this topic seems to be very clearly that:\\n\\n1. Vaccination is important for people who live where diseases like COVID spread easily (which is most places these days);\\n2. The most commonly-used COVID vaccines are very safe; and\\n3. COVID the disease is not very safe -- and in fact, many people with minimal symptoms are showing long-term cognitive deficits.\\n\\nMy own background is in quantum physics. When I feel inclined to offer up an opinion on COVID measures, or climate models, I try to imagine how I'd feel if some epidemiologist posted to Facebook that he disagrees with my last paper, because he thinks I misunderstand the Schrödinger equation.

I ask them if they realize most natural predators have been displaced. Is the cat somewhat filling that very necessary role?\\n   Yes, i understand we are losing endangered species to pet and feral cat predation. However there are MUCH more serious threats that need to be attended to asap. One this big was a winter dragonfly, as a nymph he got really big.  Look how dull his eyes and colour are, he’s had a really long life, all summer long.  His wings are amazing, I’ve seen them with lots of chips from running into trees. Was so confused of what I was looking at at first. Snakes? Giant centipedes? Reading the title definitely helps. Ugh. It will be similar. Animal or plant based as a food source and maybe dead organic material. But you can assume a lot will be bottom of the barrel feeders. They won't have violently different diets though, no, not the higher organisms. Mircoorganism will have violently different metabolisms, yes. Dragonflies typically live less than a month as adults so it is probably reaching its end soon. Sad, but that's the fate of all living things. We produce D-serine as a neurotransmitter. You’re imagining that all this stuff is programmed and built super carefully by someone who had a very clear idea of why this is all happening. These are just chemical reactions. Concepts like “purpose” are only vaguely applicable at best. \\n\\nMismatch correction and removal of primer sequences happen, yes. But they are a consequence of the simple fact that polymerase doesn’t stop when it runs into sequence ahead of it. Not only does it remove the RNA primer, but it’ll typically remove a couple hundred bases of perfectly good newly laid down DNA sequence as well. These aren’t precision instruments. They’re chemicals reacting according to basic laws of physics. I actually think that the variants always existed, it was just foreign to us. The delta variant, for example, was first noticed in India in 2020, same time as everything else happening. The issue is that we don't know until the research happens, not to mention it mutates exactly how all other respiratory viral illnesses do. We just didn't ever have it so we didn't know the different types- much like how there's 4 strains of the flu with many variations of the 4 strains. Also: its mutation rate means nothing when trying to find its origin.\\n\\nEdit: also I don't know why you think things can't mutate on their own. They absolutely can, and do.. constantly. It really depends on the laws of your country. In a couple of countries (the Netherlands, Portugal, Czech republic, Switzerland) is not illegal to consume any kind of methamphetamine for personal use, regardless on the reason why you are using it. But usually at least some methylamphetamines are categorized as controlled substances and altough consumption might not be per se illegal, possession and sale surely are. There are also several methamphetamines which are perfectly legal in almost all countries and which you can buy in any pharmacy as OTC pharmaceuticals; e.g. levo-methamphetamine and d-pseudoephedrine, but those ones are not really psychoactive so you are not going to get any of the desired effects by smoking them. And returning to your \"science project\", as others have said, only participants can take the drug, not the ones testing its effects. If you want to volunteer as a subject in any clinical trial involving a particular methamphetamine you can surely apply and if you're lucky you are gonna get to use the drug, but I still find unlikely that they will let you smoke crystals of methamphetamine hydrochloride, as other routes of administration are far more likely (for example orally or intravenously). In every case, whatever you do, just be responsible and apply every harm reduction strategy you can. Methamphetamine, just like any other pharmaceutical, is not a joke and you should be extremely careful while handling it if you don't desire to seriously harm yourself. Alfred Hitchcock was wrong.

To the extent that we can objectively call two populations separate species at all, it's when they no longer successfully reproduce with each other (at least under natural circumstances).

I’m not sure if your university is the same as mine but my first year was a big turn off as well as I was more interested in cells and genes the more nitty gritty stuff rather than populations, behaviour and ecology etc which is what most of it was or going over the scientific method.

To add to some other answers here, there's a protein called telomerase that lengthens the telomeres of chromosomes after cell division. During prenatal development, when our cells are dividing super fast, telomerase is active. But pretty much immediately after birth, it gets turned off in most of the body. If it randomly gets turned on in some cell in the adult body, it can cause cancer, since long telomeres mean potentially uncontrolled division. In Alaska we’re taught from a young age that these are poisonous, but I think there’s a way to prepare them to neutralize the lethality of the toxins so you just get drug. But it’s easy to mess up.

Try looking at this website (randomly found it on the internet).\\n\\n[https://www.wemakescholars.com/biology-scholarships-to-study-in-turkey](https://www.wemakescholars.com/biology-scholarships-to-study-in-turkey) Are you staying we don't own our bodies? Salmonella is normal flora in the gut of chickens, so it depends on how carefully the chicken is cleaned. Ok so I'll just regurgitate what I know. Plasmogamy = Fusion of protoplasm/the plasma walls. Syngamy = Fusion of gametes. Karyogamy = Fusion of nuclei. In paramecium two (iirc) haploid micro-nuclei get exchanged and then the paramecium detach from one another, then the nuclei fuse. In that instance the fusion of the paramecium would be Plasmogamy, then, later, when they detach and the nuclei fuse that would be Karyogamy.\\n\\nUsually Karyogamy follows after the plasmogamy. In some instances though, like some Basidiomycota Plasmogamy and Karyogamy happen at vastly different times. First the Hypha of two individuals fuse when they meet, and then, when the conditions are right the nuclei fuse and the mushrooms form their fruiting bodies to expel their spores.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n I'm not very knowledgable about Myxomycota however (or slime molds) and would recommend checking out the subreddit for that, as it does exist and the people there are very much willing to answer those questions. In short however slime mold reproduction They are all over here in Louisiana, we call them stink bugs. It puts off a horrible smell and if it gets squshed it pretty bad. The ones here fly. To my knowledge it's very rare for psilocybinic mushrooms to also be poisonous. I've heard of *Inocybe sps.* containing muscarine in addition to psilocybin but I can't confirm that atm. It doesn't help that hallucinogens are considered poisons by themselves in many guides which makes it hard to figure out exactly. \\n\\nYou really should be careful though, don't eat unless you're 100% sure what it is. Well that was just something from Terrance McKenna, it might have been only in that certain region. I’m worried about the course load for comp sci +bio. Would bio major and comp sci minor be good? Not anymore, that’s for sure Faxt: 45% of facts are made of on the spot. Fact. I thought we did away with the kingdom thing... Either way, those are opisthokonts, closely related to the mushrooms in my fridge. Until you touch it lol No the bees are for scale, b is for bees This needs to be higher.

It takes 10 grams of Tylenol within an 8 hour period to cause serious hepatotoxicity. While alcohol can exacerbate this, the amount you mention probably isn't enough.\\n\\nWith all that said, it isn't a good idea to mix them. I'd recommend talking to your primary care doctor for professional advice. We have different destinations but death is the ultimate destiny. I'd start with a Scientist first name Professor \"Tucan\" Last name \"Sam\" He will know which direction to point ya on which Spice Or Flavor of 'pretty bird' 🐦  she is, although by looking at the feet on that thing it's massive toes, it could be a Male \"Sam\" 🙄 This armadillo can roll perfectly\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/lbzUfZrqyvo Yes, because the smoke is absorbed into the blood streams hence finds its way to both brains. It was a secret plan to enter someone’s home and plot death.. how evil.. A lot of science is very iterative and specialized. Most discussion sections include comparisons to previous results and contrasting methods. Straight up \"diss tracks\" are less common. I was at that stage once, I vaguely recall. Aaaand now you have to tell us why!\\n\\nAlso, even the current vaccines are still in trials... Mononucleosis also causes cancer. Epstein-Barr virus. 90% of people already have it.

Nah, I'm vegan, but thanks!    :) Only the stupid ones. I’m ok with that. Have fun eating cereal sandwiches on your high horse Use web of science to find an article instead. I watched a mother cajole a young crow into flying from my neighbours roof. Fascinating, the young crow really didn’t want to take the leap but mummy nudged it off! Anti COVID vax for me as it does nothing but I’ll wear a mask if it means I can’t go to the grocery store Black and yellow orb weaver. I don’t think so, her mom isn’t pushing her to use birth control or anything and even told her that she was crazy for wanting to take birth control and still use a condom. I can confirm she said this. You probably need to start your translation with a start codon. Saffron perhaps? Maybe because insect don't have complex brain to process \" pain\". For me as a young fit person the main reasons for getting the vaccination have been:\\n\\n1. We do inhale and eat (through environmental pollution) a lot of more harmful things everyday - so why pretending the \"uhh my health\" shit \\n2. The virus can harm even fit people (my sister is still suffering from long covid syndrome even though she was perfectly healthy)\\n3. The pack immunity helps protecting the weak around us\\n\\nWe do consume everyday a lot of shitty things even if we try not to. So calm down and take the vaccine. There are fucking crazier things going on in the world. It’s actually a chicken Yes wheel bugs are definitely beneficial insects that only bite humans as a last resort in self defense. They kill pest insects by the creepy mouth strawful especially Japanese beetles, aphids and gypsy moth and tent caterpillars. They are out in force right now in Virginia!

I have a sore throat but no other issues...really wish i didn't even have a sore throat.\\n\\n>Since mrna vaccines transport the mrna via nanolipid particles they can possibly enter every cell of the Human Body and everyone is dependent of the one giving the Shot (hitting muscle =ok, hitting Arteries the mrna goes around everywhere and may settle in your brain or heart Cells causing severe damage)\\n\\nNo. The mRNA will not \"settle in your brain or heart cells causing damage\". The mRNA gets replicated in the cell's cytoplasm/ribosome. Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\\n\\n>He Heard the immune response to ‚normal‘ infections like Common colds gets messed up and in General the complete immune System may gets erroreus and doesnt work properly as it does now (in our clique/Family/ Friends many have cough/Common cold Right now me included \\[all vaccinated\\] while he is totally fine and he sees This as a confirmstion of his believe)\\n\\nThere's nothing to support that. Nothing scientific, not even theoretical. There is a bad flu going around this year, that's true though.\\n\\n>He acknowledges that mrna vaccines are Not new but questiones why all other previous tries to develop/release a mrna vaccine couldnt get past phase3 studies..\\n\\nThat was a surprise for me too. But the endpoints and outcomes of the protocol were approved and the trial results met the efficacy and safety standards. None of which were altered because of COVID. These are done by independent review boards and have to declare no conflicts of interest. There has also been failed mRNA COVID vaccines too, but that's less in the news. (Sanofi, Merck and GSK.)\\n\\n>a local doctor told him that since many are vaccinated he measures an increase in People coming in with swollen lymphknots, autoimmune deseases and Even cancer Patients where their cancer has been in remission a Long Time but Game back nearly instantaneous After the vaccination, on top many People feel tired/Lethargic\\n\\nI can't speak on this particular local doctor's experience or anything. But the adverse events of the vaccines are readily available for you to review. Glorify the creation It's more of a philosophy question Adding to the other person, the reason why the inventor frowns on IQ tests is because they are used inappropriately to argue that individuals have innate, quantifiable intelligence.  The intended goal of an IQ test is to measure changes in a person's intelligence over time.  I.e. to give a person an IQ test twice in their lives to compare how their intelligence has changed. Looks like an assassin bug!\\nThe wheel bug, Arilus cristatus, is North Carolina’s largest assassin bug. It gets its name from the prominent spiny “wheel” found on the thorax. Both nymphs and adults are generalist predators that feed on a variety of insects including aphids, caterpillars, bugs, beetles, and more. The bug uses its stout beak to inject the prey insect with a toxin that kills it within 30 seconds. Most of their prey are pest insects so they are considered beneficial to farmers and gardeners. They move slowly and are clumsy fliers. Their bite has been described as being more painful than a wasp sting so they should be admired but not handled\\n\\nRead more at: https://growingsmallfarms.ces.ncsu.edu/2020/04/birth-assassin-bug/ Go.\\n\\nTo.\\n\\nThe.\\n\\nDoctor.\\n\\nPlease.

Groundhogs are usually quite a bit bigger. No. They're Medical Doctors they understand how basic vaccines work. Then it’s commensalism for the vast majority of epiphytes like the one shown in the OP.\\nIt’s not a parasitic relationship. Homosexual AND incest! Just get some MiO packets or something and mix into bottles water Okay so with all this confidence and experience... you're looking to reddit to find out if you can mix Tylenol and alcohol because you're worried about liver damage? AND you're roasting people in the comments? Go back to the streets you connoisseur Nonsense! You’re just an eel-litist! You cant breathe in pure O2; it has to be with a lil amt of CO2. Thank you. Those are all good ideas, thank you! Don’t listen to it! Crows are all liars It's the new apple flavored Twizzler. Their gills collapse in the air, stick together. Gas exchange is all about surface area and having a layer of moisture to keep it conductive. Gills collapse on themselves in the air, and can dry out, inhibiting gas exchange.

Looks like you have a photon cannon in one lamp and a weird corkscrew bulb in the other lamp - these look the first LEDs from years back Good Morning, \\n\\nGiven that you are vaccinated I am sure that you know logically that you are unlikely to contract COVID. Also, you have indicated that you are aware that if you DO happen to contract COVID it is unlikely to cause serious GI upset. Multiplying those two probabilities based on 90% vaccine effectiveness and 25% of people having GI upset (that is your estimation I don't know the real number) would be 0.1 x 0.25 = .025 x 100 % = 2.5 % chance of you developing this dreaded symptom and 97.5 % chance of NOT doing so. However, you know this intuitively meaning that the real source of your anxiety is just anxiety itself. It is your feelings surrounding this issue, not your logical thoughts. I would recommend approaching this the way people normally approach anxiety. Things like mindfulness, breathing techniques, therapy if that is an option. \\n\\nRegarding the constipation: Fiber is probably a good idea to address that as suggested by others. Chronic constipation is not healthy. Basically members of Bacillus and Clostridia. \\nWhat I was trying to ask was which bacteria, relevant to the production of beer, remain dormant? Seems random to bring up bacteria irrelevant to this procedure \\nThe morphology of neither bacillus or clostridium does not even come close to the one in question….\\nJust saying Never thought about that. maybe top of barracuda skull Still failed to explain how covid causing cardiac arrest should only be written down as a heart attack. But ok Doc Wheel bug, its bite is wicked painful The shot keeps you out of the hospital and prevents death from the virus. Evidence is based on who is currently being admitted to hospital, unvaccinated individuals. If the shot did nothing there would be equal numbers of vaccinated and non vaccinated peoples in hospitals and that’s not what’s happening. It’s probably just old Agree with comment above, that's a LOT of salt in your diet.\\nWhat about tea? Like I have red hybiscus fruity fru fru tea from trader Joe's and it is not bad. I also like the suggestion of watering down your favourite beverages or adding some ice.\\nAlso, the 8 cups of water a day is not right. Your body should tell you when it needs water. If you drink when you're thirsty, you're fine. Avoid soda, energy drinks, fruit juice and coffee.\\n\\nI dunno, watch a bad movie, like Twilight, and play a drinking game with it? (drink every time...) Only instead of booze you chug water. I would be more afraid of the body than the arm. I don't know how much arteries behave like a hose that is kinked. The only thing we learned in first aid/first responder training about turnequets (however it's spelled is) Too dangerous, you don't have the training, dont do 'em.\\n\\nAlso, it would have to be a remarkably good movie to distract you from the pain You're welcome! Ps I don't know if this applies to street-level air pollution (lung regeneration). I'd assume one would need to cease inhalation of pollution to begin recovery (otherwise air pollution wouldn't cause 1 in 5 deaths worldwide <https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/c-change/news/fossil-fuel-air-pollution-responsible-for-1-in-5-deaths-worldwide/> ) I understand! I tried to do it but i’m not sure if it’s correct... I got 50% i’m not sure how to upload a picture as a reply but i put “MM” for Robert and “mm” for Emily so all the squares had “Mm” in them Well, that’s just the thing. You can’t really induce  an immune response against yourself by introducing a protein that’s already there. Eat them all, see what happens Maybe it's a jackdaw? Shut up and take my money! MVP over here! I think the bird predictors would have seen this coming. Most undergrads want precalc, for anything beyond that a university is generally a much better place to learn it than in high school.  Once you get into integrals and anything beyond simple calc a lot of HS teachers can be out of their depth.  Of course this depends on the system in your country but I feel it would hold pretty generally.  I personally took precalc and stats in high school and most of the calc we learned wound up being useless after a week in university. A few things. You might have negative- frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype, reflected by genotype, is going to have an advantage in the environment. For instance, if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype, a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food.  So if the light voles are more common, foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles, recognising them as good prey. This would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed. This cycle continues perpetually. \\n\\nHowever, this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness. \\n\\nMore likely on a *year to year* basis, the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another. Perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year. If there is no flooding, the dry-type genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population, however, in flooded years the wet-liking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes. [deleted] Is there some quiral compound that is used as a defence mecanism? Like secuestring the active site of the native enantiomer? Maybe try /r/fitness. Could have been poisoning by bug spray Clean the cheetos dust off the ball and they will move on. Eat it, you fucking moron. Peace. No, because evolution occurs on the population level, not the individual level. In theory, they're just bits which have been shed my megakaryocytes – they don't have a nucleus and aren't supposed to have any mRNA. Here is where it gets interesting though! If you search for certain mRNA via PCR, you can actually find it! Learnt that first hand since I'm doing research with them right now. So yeah, it's complicated. And there's surprisingly little air-tight knowledge about them. I'm currently lookin into a receptor they seem to be one of the only immune cells producing it, which enables them to bind and respond to fungi infections. Exciting stuff!! Yeah, I read 7-56 days. No. 99.99% of the bacteria are keeping you alive if it could. There are 7 billion people alive today from not drinking rubbing alcohol. Please don’t. :) Stained blue is a sign for psilocybin. Curios to learn what feedback you get as far as species I love seeing posts about empathy for even the smallest creatures. ❤️ Thank you, for at least getting it off the ground. All it is saying specifically is that it in the least triggers changes for deeper voice, it doesn't say if a higher amount leads to a deeper voice in puberty.

A lot of it's color has faded In Point Reyes National Seashore ice plant and European beach grass are damaging sand dune environments in addition to completely displacing native plants. The dunes are crucial for the western snowy plover that nest there. Controlled burns and cutting crews work to control the invasive plant populations, but there's just so much of it. If you are getting these grades working hard in your first year then I can confirm that it's just going to get harder in later years. It's usual to see a drop in grades after the first couple of years as the marking gets more strict. \\n\\n\\nThe good news is that you are seeing this early and you still have time to change degree courses. It's roughly half way through the semester, so it's not too late. \\n\\n\\nWhat else do you enjoy studying? Ordinary burning of a piece of paper.\\n\\n\\nLargely sugar, and the ultimate products are the same. Well here is where there conspiracy side comes out so this is where the line is drawn between you and me respectfully. What is considered a COVID death? You know at the beginning of the pandemic people were dying from everything (heart attacks, car accidents, strokes, etc..) but if they had the virus when they died it got labeled as them having died from COVID. So although I want to believe the current death rate I can’t because it’s been flawed from the very beginning. You don’t have to believe me. A lot of pro vax people tend to hate me for my beliefs, however this one in particular is verifiably true whether or not you wish to believe it. If knowing you tried to comfort it in it’s last days comforts you in turn, then it was worth it to you and that’s all that matters. Man, my fatass thought that was some delicious strawberry ice cream “If it’s colourful, nature isn’t hiding it for a reason” It's a wild Chungus.

I didnt know what the hell w as going on, I know I was innocent It's a female Drosophila, it's larvae and pupae Cue cards with summarised definitions and Leo points worked great for me. I was forced to do this in high school and the only way I actually remember *anything* we learned is because I had to read it, summarise it in my own words, then write it down on cue cards. Cue cards are also an easy to access tool for helping you learn *and* memorise because all you have to do is look at the back and go \"yeah that the topic I'm on\" and flip it over for the definition that you yourself wrote. Short, sweet and easy. \\n\\nI would also recommend giving your cue cards to another bio student when you no longer need them, my high school bio cue cards are apparently being passed around a university bio course in Nova Scotia. That’s awesome. The memetic trend of making fun of M.

Just giving you an extra bit of my thoughts on life and death.\\n\\nI try to be very open minded and open to criticism with my beliefs and opinions. I try to not let me ego get in the way of facts or inconsistencies in my arguments. I am willing to acknowledge when I’ve been proven wrong.\\n\\nUnfortunately I am too far down this rabbit hole and I don’t think I’ll ever be convinced. There are so many things that aren’t “fact” or written proof per say, that I believe that no one could ever convince me otherwise. Perhaps this is my own downfall. I guess I’ll never know.\\n\\nI’m a typical “conspiracist” to the majority of people(although the earth is not flat lol) lmfao\\n\\nit was “detoxification” Thanks, Nature had an article recently that laid it out as well, it's just not the case that we are leaning on a \"natural\" origin as the \"default\" because \"that's what has (mostly) always happened.\" \\n\\nI'm mostly posting this for those interested, like me, in this ongoing debate on whether we should be funding \"GoF\" research. I'm all for it as long as there is a credible scientific reason. Our biosafety measures should be able to cover any and all research risks that come up, whatever the research is.

Coleman. There may be a role for testosterone in lowering vocal pitch but there are clearly a litany of other factors that affect vocal pitch. Length of the cords, structure of the larynx, etc., may all impact vocal pitch independent of testosterone.  So having a higher vocal pitch is not itself indicative of a lower testosterone level. However, given two people in which all other variables are identical, the one with higher testosterone should have a lower vocal pitch. are you bloodhounder ? Nope. Nope they aren't.

There’s a couple of guys who eat them all the time, and grow 3x their normal size. Seem pretty magical to me…. As *Homo sapiens*, our primary evolutionary niche is being highly social pack animals with tool use.  One can argue that the first human who picked up a stick or built a sack for food was using technology.  Ergo, had we never developed tool use, Homo sapiens would likely have been overcome and out/interbred by *Homo neanderthalensis*, who also developed tool use and social pack behavior.  Some member of the Homo genus would likely be here with sapience intact, but their outlook on the world might be very different.  \\n\\nEvolution isn't about \"more advanced,\" it's about \"best suited for its niche.\"  A human and a hagfish are equally well evolved for their niches - in fact, the hagfish may be considered more highly evolved due to the noted human difficulties with bipedalism and the fact that hagfishes' designs haven't had to change in million of years because they work *so well.*\\n\\nAlso, playing with eugenics-based morality (e.g. \"who deserves to live if technology is absent,\" ubermensch fantasies) isn't a good look regardless of age. lol at actually sourcing our shitposts here I wonder if that blue and pink stain is actually a kinyoun stain? If so that could be Nocardia or something partially acid-fast instead of Proteus As mentioned here and in the comments, cells that have a high turnover include those in the digestive system and immune system. Cells in hair follicles also have a very hight turnover rate. Some chemotherapy drugs work by acting on cells that grow and divide quickly, because this is a characteristic of cancer. Consequently, these drugs also damage the hair follicles, digestive system and immune system, resulting in the common side effects of hair loss, feeling sick and being immune compromised.

Most hatch to be the size of a grain of rice, it’s considered a success when like 3 or 4 octopi out of 50,000 eggs actually make it. But for a colossal squid to grow to be 1100 pounds in under 2 years they have to be packing on average a pound and half of weight every day which is pretty amazing in my opinion. Go all in an start doing cryo-EM I’m going on YouTube to look up the bug bite/sting guy to see if he rates this one. LOL, I did *not* see where you were going with that till the end. Bravo. No, the only CO2 that's needed is produced in the body. If CO2 was inhaled in the ambient air, it would be small and there is no carrier system to take it where it would be needed; on the other hand, wherever oxidative metabolism occurs, a plentiful source is available. Most oral medications (including vitamins) must be produced in a way that ensures a uniform product that consistently delivers the intended dose to the body. One of the steps in manufacturing involves creation of granules containing the active ingredient and one or more excipients, such as binding agents. When the medication is taken, the tablet/capsule dissolves in the stomach and then the granules dissolve, releasing the active ingredient. This is typical for a water-soluble drug, but lipid-soluble drugs do a similar thing. Don't nebulize your vitamins. This is a very dumb idea unless you want lung damage.

If you have look at morphology on stains from liquid medium colony, whether it reduces nitrates, colony growth on the different media and report back They're.not cubes of you are wondering I am in med school and love anatomy (hence why my boyfriend gave them to me) so, seeing the fully intact organs, I find them beautiful and wanted to keep them > apples to oranges\\n\\nBut you can still compare them. that's one long orgy Dammit, I can't predict anything! The OP told me they didn’t need to support their claim of what was “proven” because a simple Google search would do it for me.  I Googled because that’s what OP claimed I needed to do, and I showed the mixed data I got.\\n\\nAnd second, Malone is *a* scientist who did some of the initial seminal work on mRNA vaccine technology in his early years.  He did not invent the entirety of what we have today - there are a ton of pieces to it building on more than just his work.\\n\\nYes, he does have that opinion.  Other scientists, and many more of them, have other opinions.  Those opinions involve large-scale research and published clinical trials with this vaccine technology.  Has Malone demonstrated a higher clinical incidence of vaccine adverse effects than anyone else?  Has he shown that hospitals are overflowing with people having negative vaccine reactions and dying from them?  If he’s shown this in a rigorous way as others have done for their claims, as opposed to just stating theories, he should publish it, and he’ll be easily searchable.\\n\\nWhatever Malone’s position, it’s abundantly clear that, unlike OP stated, Dr. Malone has not “proven” that infection-induced immunity is better than vaccine-induced immunity.  If you have a **peer-reviewed paper published** by Malone in a scientific journal “proving” that, as OP claimed, you are welcome to share it. This is a hard problem to answer precisely. It is sometimes called the protein folding problem. However, there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding.\\n\\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein (the part not exposed to the water solvent) is predominately hydrophobic. One way to think of it is that water don’t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds, so amino acids like leucine, iso-leucine, methionine, phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water. \\n\\nConversely many polar amino acids, like glutamate, lysine, end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent.\\n\\nMinor note, there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes. These membranes are hydrophobic in nature, and in those cases the regularities above are inverted. But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells.\\n\\nHowever, the backbone of a protein contains polar groups. It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid side-chain in the core too, and to bind with the buried polar groups. For reasons I will not get into here, buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong. If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond, you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein. Sometimes you can even have buried “salt bridges” where a negatively charged side-chain (like glutamate) is interacting with a positively charged side-chain (like lysine), and those will be quite strong.\\n\\nThere are a few special-case amino acids. Proline for example has an odd structure in that its side-chain binds to the backbone twice, not just to the alpha-carbon. Proline tends to “bend” the backbone differently from other amino acids. Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence, that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure.\\n\\nAnother special case is glycine, since it lacks a side-chain entirely. That leads to a more flexible backbone. \\n\\nAnother special case is histidine. This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH. That means that by modest changes to the environment, this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged. You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch. That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed. Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies.\\n\\nAnother special case is cystine. This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between side-chains. So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine side-chains. Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability. So again, if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence, they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure.\\n\\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs (or higher) of amino acids. You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid side-chain will end up in the tertiary structure. You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above. However, to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis. \\n\\nLet me take one special observed regularity. The so called [leucine zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leucine_zipper) is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch. This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine side-chains “zip up” very well together (recall they are highly hydrophobic). So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence, you might guess that’s going to be part of a tertiary (or quaternary) structure of a leucine zipper.\\n\\nThere are other such regularities. However, they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone. For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rules-of-thumb I’ve outlined above. \\n\\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins, their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations (say you replace one amino acid with another). So again one single amino acid side-chain change often (not always) does not change the higher-order structure. Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations. The [immunoglobulin domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoglobulin_domain) is a good example of a higher-order protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins, and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence.\\n\\nAnyways, this can go on for long, and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail. Your teacher’s hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities. You shouldn't be helping OP or anyone posting similar questions. They are looking for encouragement for stupid and dangerous self medication regiments. Stem cells use telomerase to protect themselves from telomere shortening during mitosis. The Hayflick limit applies from when a daughter cell, and not a stem cell, is created from the parent cell. This daughter cell is likely to be pluripotent or unipotent, such as an epidermal cell. Wrong sub. And no it's not. It is one that can make you trip if prepared by drying it out and then boiling for a while supposedly I think, so in a sense it is, but it's a completely mushroom than what is typically called a magic mushroom.

Looking at past evolution doesn't tell is what we \"should\" or \"should not\" do, otherwise we shouldn't breath air, ride cars, or do anything different from our ancestors. Mmmm twizzler....🤤 I don’t have an answer but I would argue that as humans don’t we do the same? So whatever emotion guides us to help other species i would extend to other animals.

Please do explain, to be clear it's a dry ski slope and not snow to be clear Maternal antibodies are passed to newborns in breast milk. These antibodies are passive - in that they were not produced in the newborn due to immune system stimulation. They will be protective, but they do not infer long-term immunity such as a vaccine or natural infection can. Interestingly, they will interfere with the immune systems ability to mount a response to a vaccine - which is part of the reason why new babies need so many boosters of vaccines. In short, the answer is no, a baby will not have a vaccine reaction due to nursing but they will receive antibodies from the maternal immune response. I don’t know Mary Sue.\\n\\nEdit: I am ignorant of Mary Sue. Thanks for the info! That'll surely help me! Well the key is to look at the final concentration. It lines up with the dilutions mentioned in the text. Often in the lab we refer to these things as a “10% solution”, for which a dilution must be prepared from the stock. Sporactivas Irishishum Beardocide.  You can tell by the milky white epidermis underneath and the red follicles.  Irish spores love beer.   It happens when you spill beer down your face and neck.

There's rarely a reason to be buying a sequencer for personal use. Even as mid sized lab it takes a lot of sequencing runs before buying the machine becomes profitable. It's cheaper and easier just to send out samples to the many public labs or companies that will sequence your sample on whatever platform you wish.\\n\\nIf you are in a lab large enough to justify the cost of then you should already be knowledgeable enough to answer that questions or speaking directly to representative from the companies. There is no single best machine. Each of the major machines offers it's own distinct advantage be that high depth of reads, long reads, cheap short plasmid reads or direct RNA reading. The ideal modality will depend on what you will be sequencing. Some do have nociceptors, but calling them \"pain receptors\" is a mistake, because pain is an emotion. They are mechanical damage / irritant receptors, and they can either prompt an unconscious reflex, or an emotional experience of suffering, or both - depending on the organism.\\n\\n[Here's a good discussion](https://askentomologists.com/2016/08/29/do-insects-feel-pain/), which makes me (also an entomologist) just a little bit unsure about what I've taken for granted for many years.\\n\\nAre they conscious and self-aware and thus capable of suffering?

Not sure Google and Reddit is the best source for you The tertiary structure if a protein is due to the interactions of those side chains of the amino acids that make the proteins up themselves i.e. a side chain with “like” charges are going to repel while opposite charges can form an ionic bond through the transferring of electrons\\n\\nMore specifically, amino acids with polar side groups are hydrophilic (water-loving) and tend to be on the surface of the protein through it’s interaction with water making it soluble in aqueous solutions. In contrast, amino acids with non-polar side groups are hydrophobic (water hating) and aggregate in the core of the protein itself.\\n\\nHope this helps :))) Im a high school bio teacher and have my masters in bio 🥼 Guess people see the comment as advocating murder of a creature, some may see it as unnecessary or cruel to just say kill it, sometimes it’s a mercy killing though. Truth is it may hurt you to kill it but it may hurt the creature more to let it suffer, if it can’t do the normal things it’s supposed to do like fly or walk, and it’s having seizures, it’s more humane to kill it. Maybe people saw virgmeister as being sadistic or mean but I think right here is the harsh but right advice to give, I mean it’s not like it’s a dog or cat that could be operated on, things a small bug that I doubt anyone on earth could open up to fix. If you exhaust yourself with tonsils, lungs and other respiratory organs suffering from inflammation, you risk inflammation of your heart muscles. Thanks a lot!! This is really useful info. Before I stained the colonies though, I didn't notice any motility when I viewed a smear under the microscope. Are there anymore biochemical tests you can recommend for Pectinatus? It will kill more than that. I always let a few in my house. We’re on the same team. Not true at all. It would be like if you completely tore my body in half, which would be a fairly quick death. I don't know that we have an *urgent* need for specific terminology to discuss alien life. Life outside of Earth is completely hypothetical. If we do find it, the relevant language will be invented then and there.\\n\\nIt's true that we'd have to make up a lot of new taxonomy, though. Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on, but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry. If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium, but we can show that it didn't evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria, we can't formally call it a bacterium. It has to be put into a brand new domain that's specific to that planet.\\n\\nIf, in a hypothetical future, we've found life on four or five different worlds, each of them appears to have emerged separately (not from some kind of panspermia event), and all life on each respective planet shares a common local ancestor (as is the case on Earth), that means you have one evolutionary tree of life per planet. So \"tree of life\" basically becomes a new taxonomic level above domain. Currently we have no need for such a taxonomic level, because it's a category with a single representative (Earth life). There is no built-in justice system in nature that allocates resources evenly.\\n\\nSome people have both good genetics and good nourishment while some people are born with no family and all kind of genetic problems. The difference in luck is huge. “Toxins” is your closest guess…so what does the liver specifically *do* with regard to toxins?\\n\\n(Also, just as a general crossword note, you should be able to guess the last four letters.) Brushing your teeth daily is good for preventing karies To add to all the great answers here and really drive the concept home, I would keep in mind the perfect specificity of B cell antibodies. Or ate it out of compassion to put it out of its mesery… It's humanities hopes and dreams that have been flushed down the toilet. Note that we would denote yellow with a lowercase g in this case. Two alleles for the same trait are written with the same letter, which is usually pulled from a description of the dominant phenotype (\"G\" comes from \"green\"). So your possible genotypes are GG, Gg, and gg. yup, it’s 15 for sure. that’s what i was originally thinking but the teachers trick worked lol. thank u 🙏🏻 To OP, just wanted to let you know that the website is IP restricted (cannot open website outside the US)... so I had to use a VPN to open it.

I have seen very rare local site reactions, painless swelling, itching and extremely rare ( I have seen 2 since the first large scale deployment and I see more than 400 people a month in a respiratory illness urgent care) lymph node swelling in the armpit on the side of the injection. I have not read any case reports of cancer in remission suddenly being “reactivated” after the mRNA based vaccines. Also cancer “in remission” is a relative thing as is the definition of “cure” in the field of oncology, as such it would be very difficult to show causation from a biologically implausible source. \\nmRNA vaccines use a standard metabolic pathway for what it is designed to do.

OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them. It's also used to make bombs.

Maybe if you preloaded the injection site with a translation inhibitor you could prevent it (at the cost of some severe side effects). An antisense vaccine administered immediately to the same site may reduce the total mRNA that gets translated but it won't prevent it entirely. Loading up on immunosuppressants may prevent immunity developing but the mRNA would still be translated. Why don’t you go hit the bong Smokey it might actually improve your personality.

FYI. But the countless stories of people “floating out” (however they choose to describe it) of their body when dead, and being able to observe and hear what’s going on in other rooms or at significant distances from their bodies is something curious. People have been able to relay conversations or describe what was happening while they were pronounced dead when they, by all known scientific reasoning, should not have been able to do that. People have met other family members that they had never met in real life, describe them to living family members who confirmed identity with pictures. There’s a lot of detail in these experiences that give glimpses into something “more”, not saying it’s God or whatever, just that it’s worth looking into with an open mind. \\n\\nI’ll admit that at first I found NDE stories comforting after leaving religion bc I have had personal experiences that lead me to believe that there is more. I felt it couldn’t be the Judeo Christian god, that’s all such nonsense and bonkers. I’ve come to the personal conclusion that it doesn’t matter what we believe only how we live (honestly, even that doesn’t “matter”). Whether there’s something after this life or not, we DO have this tangible life right now and it’s what we should put all our focus toward. Not wondering or fearing what happens after this life, that’s silly and wasteful. So now, I just find the NDE topic, and the study of psychedelics, pretty fascinating. Because it IS a glimpse into our brains and psychology. Whether it’s spiritual or physical, it’s interesting either way. Effector cells are basically the activated cells that carry out a specific function in response to a stimulus. Take B cells - when activated by T cells, they differentiate into effector plasma cells, which are the ones that actively secrete the antibodies. The effector T cells would be the CD4+ Helper T cells and the CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Once an infection has been dealt with, sone of the B cells & T cells remain around afterwards, incase the same infection ever occurs again. These are the memory cells and these are not really effector cells.

It was really bugging me, making me winder if I was seeing things that aren’t there. By the virus I assume you mean covid. After disinfecting probably extremely low. But the truth is we are constantly exposed to viruses and bacteria, and I literally mean 24/7. When we brush our teeth we expose ourselves to pathogens. But the vast majority of the time your innate immune system can deal with the infection pretty well. Or you’ll have immune memory from previous infections. In both cases to the point that you don’t even experience symptoms. Your immune system is a power and amazing thing!! Unless your immuno compromised I suppose but even then. \\n-BA in Mol Cell and Dev Biology I've never heard of a black life, is that something to do with vampires and goths?

Maybe they should just skip the plants and go directly to the nipples They can bite. They are a relative of kissing bugs. Don’t know if they carry Chagas’ disease or not. Supposed to be a nasty bite Thanks so much for completing the survey! I understand how hard depression can be (although not to the same extent).

There are different viruses that cause colds, and all of those viruses mutate, so even if you have immunity to one, that same one could mutate and express different proteins, or have different modes of infection. \\n\\nLook at it this way, you could be literally dying of a common cold if you're immune system had zero memory or capability of adapting as quick as it does, so actually its doing a pretty good job. It is  tobacco hornworm, *Manduca* *sexta*, a close relative of the tomato hornworm. Tobacco hornworms are moth caterpillars (not worms) with diagonal white lines on the sides (like cigarettes) while tomato hornworms have white \"V\" shapes, or chevrons (as in \"V\" for vine-ripened tomato, if you like mnemonics to remember things).\\n\\nBoth will feed on most plants in the tomato family, and supposedly do well on wheat germ if you want to raise them. The adult moths are ususlly called tobacco hawk moth. People who say that don’t understand the basic foundational principals of the theory of evolution.  Evolution has no end goal, just random mutation and selection pressures. What I tried to explain is that it is an integral part of how the body works. The systems it takes part in derive from its essential role in metabolism, if that need was not there, it wouldn't exist. The carbonic anhydrase component is the best example of this, if no CO2 were present, that buffering system would not have evolved and if it were suddenly absent the organism would not survive. FYI, a very small amount of CO2 is expelled by hemoglobin, but that's not sufficient for survival. I think k it was a joke guys calm down Can you just say you're talking about the mRNA vaccines so these people can actually answer you properly? I have a dog and these are in my area as well. Why?

You would have to eat like 4 to 5 fresh caps to get effects, however this is not recommended as fresh caps contain ibotenic acid ( a brain lesioning agent). Although if this was a single occurence, i doubt you'd have much, if any, damage from eating them. The right way of preparing them is to place them in an oven at about 175 for 40 minutes to decarboxylate the ibotenic acid into muscimol (the desired psychotropic compound). This is the same process for preparing cannabis to make edibles. At that point, 20 grams eaten will be a very strong psychotropic trip. You can also smoke them to get effects without risk of ibotenic acid poisoning. Let's say an enzyme is wrapped in lipid nanoparticles..... how could the enzyme be metabolized in a very rapid manner by either separating the lipid nanoparticles or  by other means such as \"neutralizing\" or making the substance inert Perhaps you would prefer squishing?

And student loans.. Of coarse Thx, that was useful <3 Fair enough. Looks like Fusobacterium nucleatum but I’m not sure if that would ever grow in beer haha. It can grow in anaerobic conditions though and can tolerate acid, but it is usually associated with the oral cavity or colon so I may well be wrong with identifying this.\\n\\nEdit: just did some Googling on pectinatus and I agree it could be this as it’s associated with beer spoilage!

A møøse bit my sister Sigourney Weaver's arch nemesis. Depends on the job, but usually yes. It’s important to be familiar with the relevant literature. It does get easier when you get used to the jargon, the writing style, and the stats.

I just wanted to see from the WP opinion piece, which referenced the two dog experiments, but only provided a link to the first experiment I mentioned (paper looks standard), if anyone knew of a link to a paper regarding the second one- the one making the rounds in Republican media, plus whether there was any corroborating evidence for the ape story, also doing the same rounds, and originally from WCW. Can confirm. Got bit by one (0/10 would not recommend) and daughter used an app on her phone to identify it. Never thought about that. Can I ask why? I have heard that it's a bad but everyone just points out the person who apparently invented it as to the reason why its bad. So why is it a bad measure? Bc it tests only one aspect of intelligence which is a very broad thing? Google: Erythropoesis A hive of snake bees Haha, drunken buggo goes 🗿 If you're familiar with R you could use a package like TCGAbiolinks to get the FPKM values for all the PAAD samples, then grab the values for the gene you want out of that. I think your best bet is to go on pubmed, and search for reviews either about the specific animals or the concept in general. If a paper is pay walled, just use sci hub It's dying and there's nothing you can do about it. Insects have a much *much* shorter life cycle than people, being mature for anywhere between a week and two months in the case of dragonflies. That didn’t help me understand I’m still confused Yes.

Idk the sconce name but it’s just some form of bacteria building up in moist/dark environment I meant specifcially on this Earth, but the answer is appreciated Agreed, *Serretia* *marcescens* or (less likely) another species in the genus. The bulk of what's on your stopper is probably hard water deposit as others said, with the pink color due to the bacterium biofilm.\\n\\n*S*. *marcescens* is an interesting critter. It can feed on a variety of chemicals but seems to fail in areas that dry out routinely. It's extremely common in bathrooms and other manmade locations in spots that stay wet. It's generally harmless, but in immunocompromised peple and (some? rarely?) infants can cause or add to potentially serious skin, wound, and internal infections. It is apparently not rare on tooth and gum biofilms.\\n\\nOne strain of *S*. *marescens* is found in bees and may contribute to some colony failures. Genetic engineering could easily replace natural evolution or the the need to eat organic food in the near future. mutation rate (or frequency) etc. Still, those are very broad.\\n\\nWhat are you searching?

Science is a poor option for career options unless you want to go into medicine (which is highly competitive). He's probably just really torn up about the Dragonfly. 😄 Completed it! Gene modification should be done sparingly on defects and mutations and avoided for things like IQ and phenotypes. There is an interesting philosophy called externalism which takes this sort of thing into account.\\nFor example, if a beaver didn't learn how to make dams it would have had to physically evolve much more to catch the same amount of fish. These extra adaptions come with a cost though as you would be so much bigger and require more calories like a bear.\\nHuman adaption is very much the same, we have evolved things external to ourselves. Technology, agriculture, medicine etc which has limited the adaptions needed by us physically.\\n\\nI know this probably hasn't answered your question but thought it fit here well. \"Someone get me the Ghostbuaters\" And unfortunately I did not pick this topic.

Just alien sperm nothing to see here. It looks like it is from the family Amaurobiidae. It appears to closely resemble the Callobius bennetti, or the Hacklemesh Spider, however, those are native to North America, and not the UK. I cannot, at this time, narrow it down any further. I have seen a few with this dorsal abdominal pattern, but none so black. It could be I’m merely finding examples of juveniles, but I think this is a direction you could start looking in. \\n\\nOne with a close abdominal pattern match:\\n\\nhttps://bugguide.net/node/view/49044\\n\\nOne with similarities in legs and carapace \\n\\nhttps://arachnoboards.com/gallery/callobius-bennetti.69599/\\n\\nPatterns and colorings aren’t always the best ways to determine exact species of spiders due to the extreme variations of such during its lifecycle. A spider can change/differ rather drastically from sling to juvenile to adult and from female to male. With each molt brings new changes, new surprises to behold.\\nEye arrangements are best to classify family, and typically, leg details such as leg to body proportions, leg shape and placement, and toe count, along with spinneret, pedipalp (of the male), and ventral abdomen (of a female) characteristics help identify the particular species. These last two are usually used by experts, though, and not the general enthusiast, as you have to work fairly hard to get perfectly focused shots of a very minuscule subject at very iffy angles.\\nHere is a link to those eye arrangements if you’d like to compare your little fella.\\n\\nhttps://bugguide.net/node/view/84423#Amaurobiidae\\n\\nThis following one matches rather closely, right down to the little white leg accents if you pay attention in photo, the legs on the far side of the body.

Soap scum is [a totally different thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_scum). I did try searching your link to see if it was a common slang for the pink mold but there was nothing there. Soap scum is one of the things pink mold eats though. They are two different words and have two different meanings. I was clarifying their meanings since the OP said English is not their first language.  \\n\\nAlso, people in the scientific community do care about the meanings of these words. Here are a few posts you may enjoy. \\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/pz0w25/what_defines_ones_biological_sex_is_biological/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/pcwbyx/is_sex_really_a_social_construct/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share I'll attempt to answer your question in the most straight forward and simplistic way I can.  I'll avoid getting too detailed so you can wrap your mind around the basic concept of viruses. \\n\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nViruses don't \"want\" anything or have goals, motives, desires or intent. Viruses exist to only to replicate. \\n\\nViruses are completely reliant on a host to do the replication for them. \\n\\nVirulence is a human created term to categorize the severity of illness caused by a viral infection. \\n\\nSome viruses cause little, if any, ill effect on the host.\\n\\nSome viruses cause the host to fall ill for prolonged periods of time. \\n\\nSome viruses can infect a host for the duration of the host's life. \\n\\nSome viruses can cause severe acute illness followed by death. \\n\\nSome viruses infect a host just once but leave the host forever scarred or with significant long-term health issues \\n\\nMany viruses are host specific, meaning they can only infect a certain specie(s).  \\n\\nViruses infect very specific cellular systems within the host specie(s).  \\n\\nThoes infected cells are \"hijacked\" by the viral genetic information and given instruction to replicate the virus over and over and over again until the infected cell bursts with millions of copies of the virus.  \\n\\nThe replicated viral copies quickly infect the adjoining cells and the process repeats until either all the cells are destroyed or the immune system of the host gets the viral invasion under control. \\n\\nMutations during the replication process drive the evolution and success of viruses. \\n\\nThe more the virus is able to replicate, the higher the probability of a mutation occurring. \\n\\nMutation are caused by errors made in the replication process.  Nearly all mutations are unsuccessful dead-ends for the virus. \\n\\nSome chance random mutations may make the virus more successful. \\n\\nA \"beneficial\" mutation may give a virus ability to replicate at a greater rate, in greater numbers, infect different cellular systems or even infect other species.\\n\\nWhen a virus mutates to infect a new  specie(s), it becomes a novel virus for the new host(s). \\n\\nA novel virus can be highly virulent on a new host because the new host has no immunity to combat the virus. \\n\\nA novel virus can replicate unchecked within the new host specie because there is no \"programed\" immune response to combat the novel viral infection.  \\n\\nWhen a virus is given the opportunity to replicate unimpeded, the probability of a successful mutations increases. \\n\\nAs the virus mutates through host replication, it may become more virulent on the host. \\n\\nIf a virus is overly virulent on its host, it often leads to an evolutionary dead end - in other words, if all the hosts are killed by a virus, the virus won't be able to replicate and will go extinct.\\n\\nOver time, natural selection tends to favor the mutations that make virus more transmissible over mutations that make it more virulent. \\n\\nThe most successful viruses are ones that have evolved to be highly transmissible but have minimal virulent effects on the host. \\n\\nSome viruses can be highly virulent on certain individuals in the host population and have no virulent impact on other individuals within the same population. \\n\\nOver time, the genetic traits in thoes unaffected individuals will be passed along to subsequent generations and become the dominant trait within the host population.  \\n\\nThis relationship between viruses and their hosts has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years. It's known as an evolutionary \"arms race\". \\n\\nViruses have always, and will continue to always be one of the selection factors driving the evolution and diversity of species on our planet.  \\n\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nAgain, I tried to make the information very simple and loose.  I left our a tremendous amount of information in hopes to provide some insight without confusion. This is r/physics question.\\n\\n10ms to detect muzzle flash and ~250ms to move your head assuming bullet aimed at  head.  So roughly again ~250ms to doge.  Bullet travels at ~500 m/s so if the shooter is 125 meters away and does a head shot, you may be able to dodge it. Usually yes, but the word \"monster\" can also be used to describe real things, e.g. serial killers, or man-eating animals. Well, I can tell you that your liver won't much appreciate weekly binge drinking, regardless of whether there's any other drugs involved. I once swallowed some meat, some vegetables AND some drink all at the same time. I was very proud of myself for achieving this. You're lack of an ability to read past one sentence speaks to your reticence to discuss your scientific qualifications (such a stunning lack academic prowess undoubtedly hindered any feeble attempt at education that you could have potentially mustered) while also shining a light on your distaste for the questions here as the first sentence of any question put forward is unlikely to adhere to the academic rigor that you require from others but are clearly unable to obtain for yourself. Bitch. Speaking as a fly researcher: you have to burn your house down sorry Wow, that's awful. You could sew a horse dick to yourself, sure. It would probably rot and fall off and probably make you quite sick in the process. Acting hurt and waiting until you fall asleep I'm pretty sure that the current pandemic has made bats way spookier for many people Yup, I think this might be the best observation. There are some megataxonomies of viruses that emerged prior to LUCA, and their genomes also work with the standard twenty amino acids. So, while observing that both archaea and bacteria use all twenty may show that at least LUCA used these twenty amino acids, that all viruses also use them suggests a far more primitive, probably pre-cellular adoption to the twenty amino acids.\\n\\nSomeone could argue that it's possible that all megataxonomies of viruses only adopted the standard twenty after LUCA and only later evolved towards the current system as a result of evolution. So, while it seems quite implausible, the argument may go that it is at least *possible* this doesn't prove viruses indicate an earlier origins of the twenty amino acids than LUCA. But it turns out that LUCAs own genome is filled with viruses that used the standard twenty amino acids. So LUCAs own virome helps confirm an earlier origins of the twenty. [See](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x) the new paper \"The LUCA and its complex virome\" (*Nature* 2020). I suppose you could say it's an assumption, but not a very far fetched one. The op did say 'his friend isn't sick when others around him are which is why he believes this'. That to me means he didn't really research, he's just going by his personal observations. Oh okay I didn't realise they said this. Thanks for sharing Excuse me, but I actually showed and **incredible** amount of empathy. Similar to an empathetic bullet in an injured mare’s head.

Stained extremely vibrant blue when pinched Ok sure but I don’t think this comment was invalid in anyway. I’m no anti vaxxer, but I don’t see anything wrong with him sharing an experience OP asked about. Not the % that i just cooked on the grill 5 days past use date apparently. You're arguing that the endocrine system needs to be lumped in? We don’t know, but it’s getting farther away as time goes on so well probably never know. No but sometimes spores can be toxic so it is recommended to not do this. You can touch even the most deadly mushroom and be okay, but you do not want want ingest any tissue or spore if you don't know what it is. Additionally, the spores from magic mushrooms are not what get you high, you need to eat the actual mushroom. Ok but can I drink it anyway? If it’s served cold on a hoy day I probably won’t notice… and I’ll blame the next day diarrhea on the poor choices of snacks I select after the third one… You don't think facts can be used to promote false ideas? That's a simple trick... Really appreciate the time and effort put into this. It makes perfect sense :-D. Thank you so much! So the glucose we get from gluconeogenesis and eating food will be exactly the same in structure, however the function of the glucose at any point in time might differ to suit the body’s current needs. Gluconeogenesis only occurs when you are low on fuel. (Hungry)\\n\\nIf hungry —> glucose is broken down for energy\\n\\nIf not hungry —> glucose is converted to fuel-storage molecules.\\n\\n\\nEXPLANATION: \\n\\nWhen you eat a meal but are not starving, your body is not short of energy, so the food you eat won’t be broken down to produce energy as it would basically be wasted (it’s more complicated but is sufficient to explain my point). Instead, the body converts the glucose into fuel-storage molecules such as glycogen and fat to give the body an emergency fuel source.\\n\\nHowever, when you are starving, your body is low on glucose. The body needs to maintain a steady glucose concentration for survival, so it produces glucose by gluconeogenesis. This glucose has a different function than the glucose we ingest because in this case, we are starving and need fuel to survive. So instead, the glucose is broken down to produce energy for the body. So what are particle sizes then? In regards to B vitamins. Why does your body have to make them small to use them aren't molecules already small by default? And is PH also important for it to work? Nebulizer make the molecules small correct? Why is that? It doesn't just produce heat but also breaks the substance down kind of like dissolve right? One day my eyebrow started burning like all hell and when I reached up to rub it, that thing was chilling there! Thanks for your reply, i agree with you that all Mds may have Access to the latest research results but at least speaking for my Family doctor as weil as Friends Family doctors the are >50 and cant to anything More than giving me a prescription or certification of incapacity for my employer..

You helped me a lot!    :) Picture Insect Fair enough. I respect your choices and opinions. At the end of day if I die from COVID because I didn’t get the vaccine I accept that. they aren’t perfectly spherical and won’t get very far. They are made to fold up and just sit in one place, it would most likely go the speed at whatever rolled it and then trail off track and gradually stop Cry me a river and go read a book for once or r/ShroomID or r/shrooms Don't look like any boomers to me. Ordinary burning of a piece of paper.\\n\\n\\nLargely sugar, and the ultimate products are the same. Your eyes aren't. Nothing you clean it with will save the flapper, you’ll need to replace it I believe it correlates with a higher potential of both positive and negative behaviors.  Human powers can always be used for both good and evil, depending on the state of mind of the individual.  Think about the classic antagonistic evil genius so popular in modern literature and film. Viruses are defined by some as alive and others not. This shows that the division is a human concept and not necessarily a line in nature itself. \\nHowever, you are talking about self-organising chemicals, I think. If so, I just did a quick search and Wiki has a page called, Self-organization\" that you might be interested in. Try speaking in Latin; if it glows, voila! It’s got hints of licorice and anise.

You can put points in both if you really want to, but then you have to have a low strength stat and that just causes even more issues. Look, it's very complicated biology that I'm definitely not just making up and I won't do your research for you. Gotta post the results if he did that one. I would say eating kind but I don’t want to cause something dumb to happen so do not eat them until you know what they are fully and then I’ll say eat them as a joke, stay safe Can we get a picture of how it’s growing on the plate? 😊 maybe try water flavoring? I used to not drink water at all during my 6th grade year cause i thought i tasted nasty and had a sharp texture, and mind you at the time i was drinking about 4 liters of pop a day but i saw a ad for Mio and decided to give a try and haven’t had a problem drinking water since Ok thanks My take is this: as a westerner who’s used to pronouncing western names (read English, German, etc. etc.) names from eastern countries can be difficult to pronounce. It didn’t start because his name was funny-ish to begin with (a la Benedict Cumberbatch) it started because white people can’t put in the effort to pronounce an Indian based name correctly. There’s been plenty of tweets and articles written about it that you can look up if you put down your devil’s advocate card for 30 seconds. So, M. Night Shyamalan’s name is not hard to pronounce and if you make that “Shama-lama-ding-dong” reference that a LOT of people do, I’m gonna call you a racist. Have you checked Libgen.is (library genesis)? You might be able to find it there But what bread? I’m located in the Middle East if that helps identification So what would it do? Hallucinogenic? They are both incredibly beautiful and interesting at the same time Wikipedia says that some studies dated LUCA to 3.5 bya - 3.8 bya, and one recent study dated it to 4.5 bya. Since there were multiple estimates and all seemed to agree that it was at least approximately 3.5 bya, I chose to say “at least 3.5 billion years ago” in my reply. Hope this answers your question. Could be a herpes flair up. If you get cold sores, they can crop up when your immune system is under attack by something else. Hence why they’re called “cold sores” Well that’s definitely a frog on the right. Yes we do it all the time Looks like a June Bug lol Yeah it's a small batch and it'll be finished by the weekend. I'll have to take a look at my equipment and do some extra cleaning. The article is paywalled, so unfortunately I can't read it all, but just based on the info in the title and the first few lines...\\n\\nYour blood cells are made by blood stem cells in the marrow of your bones. Your blood cells inherit their DNA from these stem cells.\\n\\nIf there's something wrong with your marrow (or your blood) and you require a transplant, you've now got someone else's blood stem cells sitting in your bones, making new blood cells. The new blood cells will inherit their DNA from the stem cells that made them, so now you also have blood cells with the donor's DNA in them. This doesn't mean all of the DNA in your body is replaced, it just means your blood in particular is now a genetic mix of cells containing your own DNA (which your own marrow made) and cells containing the donor's DNA (which the donated marrow made).\\n\\nThis is true for any organ transplant, by the way. If you receive a kidney transplant, the DNA in that kidney doesn't change to match yours. You retain the donor's kidney cells, with their own DNA, for as long as you keep that donated kidney.\\n\\nThe title of the article is a little silly, with the \"5000 miles away\" thing. The distance is irrelevant. The cells are sitting right there in your marrow, so the change isn't transferred across a distance or anything. Yes we do it all the time Thanks so much for completing the survey! I understand how hard depression can be (although not to the same extent). Any and all help during tough times can be life-changing, and if we could prevent those situations from arising in the first place how much better could the world be? I don't have much expertise on it but a recently discovered spider in Madagascar has the strongest web. Its silk is considered to be the toughest known biological material. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin%27s\\_bark\\_spider I thought it was that they would drink the urine of reindeer that had eaten amanita muscaria. You’re repeating what you’ve heard or it’d be obvious that some of your statements have no foundation besides someone’s word and if that’s the case then chocolate milk comes from brown cows because 16 million Americans believe that to be true. The tests didn’t pass the third phase at all but since people get kick backs it was pushed forward That’s biological science for ya. . . True. But there are people who post on Facebook under their real name, so a caution about that would be warranted. It’s personal, and should be private, but not all employers would respect that. I've read the Wikipedia article, they seem like pretty awesome little creatures. Especially the bit about them being a sign of a healthy ecosystem, surely that should mean the sight of them should be a good thing? Their feeding methods are scary but very similar to other predacious insects, and the article said they are docile around and don't care about humans unless they feel threatened.\\n\\nAll in all they look like great little friend to your garden! We don't have any Assassin Bugs in the UK, the closest I think are damsel bugs?\\n\\nCan't really judge for being freaked out by them though, given that despite all I know about how good and cool (very elegant evolutionary \"design\") spiders are (harmless as well in the UK) yet they *terrify* me. Keep a couple bags in there eh? Don't have to go grocery shopping as often. Forbidden urinal cake.     (Yum) That number wasn't cherry picked, bro... it came directly from the CDC website.

Drugs are distributed differently in plasma and tissues depending on how lipophilic they are (as well as some other properties).\\n\\nWhen drugs from the plasma are metabolized, more drug generally leaves the tissues and enter into the plasma to maintain the concentration equilibrium. You may have to do a genetic test the sex of the bird (some vets offer them for free). Birds gonads are internal until they need them for mating so you won't be able to tell. Unless this species is sexually dimorphic (i.e. males are one color while females are another), you'd have to get a genetic test done to determine the sex.\\n\\nAlso, sex and gender are two different things. Sex is determined by the individuals reproductive organs. While gender is a social construct that revolves how an individual feels or identifies about one's self. \\n\\nEdit so OP question answered first. How are you so sure they only live a couple of years at most? Just because other cephalopods have short life spans does not mean their other relatives do. Ravens also have long shaggy neck feathers and tend to have a more rounded head crest whereas crows' are flatter and give the impression of a pronounced brow. You’re welcome!! Thanks for the explanation - that’s really interesting! :D We cannot make assumptions about the outside planets, we dont know nothing about aliens, we never saw them, we dont have any authonomy to make an Absolute claim.\\n\\nBut looking at Animals and humans, we can presume that each planet has different natures and you can hybridize with them, I would like to have a name for each nature, and see its ratio. \\n\\nI also need a name for our old planet, it cant be Just random letters or numbers, but something more remarkable, like the mythology names from our solar system neighbors I can't identify it, but I do want to say that you should maybe try to get it into the hands of an expert.

Legend has it the more you stick up your butthole the longer life you’ll live. They are all hand drawn personally by him I'd reccomend you call the support number provided by the organization or goverment that applied the vaccine and ask for orientation, the effectiveness will be affected differentely depending on which vaccine (lab origin) you were applied, though I doubt it's anything to worry about I thought this was in the Finland subreddit at first because I saw one of these outside my Helsinki apartment at one point.

What you describe is a basic form a social anxiety and is sometimes treated with stimulants like Adderall. I recommend checking out these links for more information.\\n\\nAlso, take time to read about how addicting this drug can be and the negative effects that you can experience when coming off of it. \\n\\n\"How does Adderall reduce social anxiety?\\n\\nAdderall is a psychostimulant that causes dopamine to be released into the brain. Additionally, it does release norepinephrine and can affect serotonin. This drug makes most people feel good, focused, and productive. It releases social anxiety by stimulating the brain so that during social situations, you don’t have difficulty thinking of what to say; it makes you feel calm and focused at the optimal dose.\"\\n\\nhttps://mentalhealthdaily.com/2013/03/03/adderall-for-anxiety-disorders-a-counterintuitive-treatment-option/\\n\\nhttps://www.mdlinx.com/article/methylphenidate-improved-both-social-anxiety-and-adhd-symptoms-in-adults-study-found/lfc-1260\\n\\nhttps://www.theraleighhouse.com/addiction-blog/adderall-and-social-anxiety\\n\\nhttps://www.addictioncenter.com/stimulants/adderall/ Or a flamethrower.

For someone who is ambiguous on the subject or thinks that COVID-19 originated in a lab, I recommend a recent paper titled \"The origins of SARS-CoV-2: A critical review\" in *Cell*. I think the case is sufficiently compelling to say that the origins was natural. Not a biologist, no real insight into this. For me the question is: Do the animals that participate in homosexual sex then give up on/forget about heterosexual sex? If the answer is yes then they clearly made a choice and prefer the homosexual relationships. If the answer is no then maybe they are confused? I’ve seen my female cats mount other females though, clearly taking in the male/top position, which should be against their instinct.

I don't think the issue is with excessive expression of the mRNA, honestly. Right from the beginning, i ruled out mRNA because of the weak responses and thought that the more traditional vaccines would be more effective in a pandemic. The mRNA technology tends to yield weak response (or so i thought) and requires more doses/longer periods of time. Given that each shot is only injecting micrograms of API, it's not really a concern.

It cant happen. Well the only way to \"remove/neytralize\" a compound is by changing it to something else.\\n\\nMetabolizing something is chemically changing it to something else just using natural biocuemical processes. You can hypothetically chemically modify it too but youll likely mess with the entire tissue its in. For example you could incinerate the hell out of the compound but everything around its messed up too. You could use acids to degrade it but those acids will mess with the around tissue too.\\n\\nYou could maaybe get some sort of high affinity compound specific to the said compound, bind that high affinity complementary compound to a magnetic nanoparticle and  diffuse that through something and then recollect the particles but if its a tissue those nanoparticles arent going to be able to spread as ubiquitously. If it was just a solution then sure but not something like muscle tissue. (Also recollecting nanoparticles through muscle tissue using a magnet woildnt likely work or would at least be very painful Yo you are *way* more aware than the average conspirator I meet online. You are seriously like a unicorn or something similar. I believe in you human. I wouldn’t hold it against you if you changed it up and got your shot. I live in the same part of the state and have been seeing them around too, glad you cared enough to ask so I could learn something too If distilled water is present on both sides then “no” net osmosis occurs. If the solution is different (one side distilled/RO, another including solubles in water or non RO Water) then Osmosis occurs leaving one side with solubles (minerals, etc…) and other side with RO water. Therefore when solubles are left behind there is less water content (on the side that has not yet been filtered). In lamest terms non filtered side has less water content since it’s being cluttered with solubles (minerals etc…) You have to jump down a sewer pipe for that work tho... I can't think of any but maybe if you go find a sub here or a Facebook group that talk about the Bermuda Triangle or something like that, they might be able to steer you in the right direction.

Damn that's fascinating You guys are scaring me, i've been reading studies on covid and the vaccine cuz i wanna get my vaccine (even tho discouraged by my parent) and i was pretty set on getting the vax soon but now idk if i should just play my chances with covid.

Ugh this is confusing and scary https://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=does+obesity+in+puberty+affect+hormones&oq=does+obesity+in+puberty+affect+hor#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DNZsTSS4KIpUJ here's another study, the role of hormones in obesity and puberty is complicated. Obesity in children has been associated with an early onset of puberty in girls, as well as a decrease in growth hormone in both boys and girls. This is a groundhog. Prairie dogs are usually smaller. While that's true with strategic and economic decisions, more often in daily life you need to make decisions that include and influence other people, and there empathy would help you make better decisions. My point is simply that intelligence and empathy aren't mutually exclusive. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_fly completely harmless if so Hairyus Bellyius >proteins don't target cells\\n\\nNot true.

São bromélias que usam a árvore como apoio. Você deveria deixá-las como estão. Don't overdo it. Hold on I think it might be because an RNA sequence is composed of ribonucleotides which have a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the 3rd carbon atom of their pentose whereas DNA has a hydrogen atom (-H) since it's composed of deocyribonucleotides. But can DNA polymerase I recognize that? It’s the god damned Loch Ness monster. I’m not saying I want to get sick because I don’t but in my personal opinion, I’m not any more scared of COVID than the regular flu. I think everyone should stay healthy prior to getting sick to naturally fight off diseases. \\n\\nAlso to challenge your stats you linked, what is considered a COVID death? Because as you remember (I hope you know this) at the beginning of the pandemic people were dying in car accidents who tested positive for COVID and they would list that as a COVID related death. I want to know how or what their standards are for death from COVID. Hospitals would do this misreporting to get more money from the government this isn’t conspiracy this is documented.\\n\\nI think if people were already healthy and stayed healthy they shouldn’t have anything to worry about. Even tho heart disease is higher (people being overweight) no one is concerned about raising awareness of that it’s only about this current virus which I think is a little ironic. You can't draw conclusions about the relationship between two concepts in the general population based on only your personal experience. Emotional skills, including empathy, can be significantly improved through practice. It means that EQ isn't as fixed as IQ, and that being highly intelligent is not an obstacle to learning people _skills_ later in life. Now of course there might be other factors that hold you back from being able to relate to others and manage your own emotions, but a high IQ alone isn't to blame for it. Ignorance usually come with Mary sue..... Not the other way. This is biology sub. It wants to tell you the extended auto warranty on your car is expiring If the mods are overwhelmed with moderating, they need to reach out and request more people apply. This is getting ridiculous. Ignoring reports and modmail isn't helping anyone. So many factors in this to think about.\\n\\n\\nAssuming the absolute best healthcare and the highest motivation of everyone involved in this operation, I would guess you have 4-8 hours max to reattach the main vessels and that's just to get bloodflow back.\\n\\nYou must then worry about the rush of metabolites from the oxygen starved appendage likely going straight to your heart lungs and brain and having nasty effects and maybe even throwing your heart into a non perfusing rhythm.\\n\\nAssuming this arm is reattached we then can debate on the neurological recovery of the arm which from my understanding is a crap shoot. Better the health of the person the better the outcome but no guarantee either way. I guess we also \"should not\" be multicellular organisms, since that was a mutation too. Looks like food! Fry those up and have yourself a free dinner. Never understood why people don't share notes.

She doesn't want to hear it. Thank you :\\] Weren't those in starship troopers? Yes, but what I am asking is to correlate 2 things that are difficult to correlate. I think it would be interesting for a few different reasons to see what a “minimum living thing” would look like. being sanitary and disinfecting all of your equipment and bottles are the most important steps in making a good home brew. Well, the cell will either be transfected or lysed. \\n\\nTransfection: the virus injects its DNA into the cell, and has its DNA incorporated into the cell. From there, the viral genome will remain in the genome until the \"right time\", upon which it will be activated, begin producing viruses, and lyse the cell. This can be long-term and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated.\\n\\nLysing: The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell, and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome. Tons of viruses will be produced, so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses.\\n\\nNow, there is another possible fate. It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell, but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating. It just kind of stays there. Then, it's possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome, a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless. If this happens, the mutated (and therefore dysfunctional) viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse. There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome. This is not only true for our genome, but true for the genome of virtually every known organism. Even the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) [has a full virome of its own](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-020-0408-x). Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes, and it started producing viruses again. If I'm not mistaken, there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses, such as in organ transplant. Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs, but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies. bleach and any acid really.  \\n\\n\\nBut for real. Dilution is how you avoid this problem. It is not hard and you don't need excessive washing. A flush or two and your good. Back in the day the tribe's medicine man would eat the mushrooms then the rest of the tribe would drink his urine for the effect. It’s the pink slime McDonald’s makes their nuggets from. 😅 Penguins are birds; they have feathers. For a projectile to do damage it has to be accelerated quickly to a high velocity. The explosion that fires a bullet being one example. The only other way is to provide sufficient distance that a smaller force can act for longer to achieve that same goal. \\n\\n\\nWith a punch, the body constrains the distance available and so high acceleration is needed. This is limited by how quickly the muscles can contract. The amount of excess tension in other muscles is also a retarding factor to that acceleration. \\n\\n\\nA punch just using the arm will be quicker, but the more powerful punches need to engage the rest of the body, which again reduces speed. Of course, this is dependent on your definition of the punch and when it starts. You could, theoretically, describe the initial body movement as pre-punch dynamics. are you bloodhounder ? What is more strange is that the English word for this German phenomenon is \"portmanteau\", which is French. It is demonstrative of some of the inconsistent heritage of English.\\n\\n[What is also weird is the amount of different types of compound nouns that English is able to form.](http://englishclub.com/grammar/nouns-compound.htm) I mean it can get flushed out faster if the enzyme responsible for its metabolized is induced.

Mutations happen, the environment changes, and as we’ve all seen this past year diseases burn their way through the population. \\n\\nYou gotta think that 99.99% of all life on this planet has gone extinct, perhaps plastics will be our downfall before climate change. I’ve been seeing some studies where immature cetaceans are starving to death because their parents have too much plastic accumulated in their mammary glands. Humans are definitely getting dosed with plastics as well as inorganic compounds and those that are genetically predisposed to be able to better handle that have an increased chance of reproducing The dragonfly signed off on the paperwork?

So good luck asking the insect how he’s holding up Technically yes, but not your best psychedelic experience option. Ask Ben Franklin. I'll disagree with saying dopamine is \"the cause\" of addiction. Here's my view. Addiction is a lock and key. If you gave Adderall to a large random sample some would hate it, some would not. Some fraction would be more mentally effective but not addicted, and some would become addicted regardless of any pharmacological benefit.\\n\\nAn example: I was on morphine for about 2 weeks after serious surgery when I was in my early 20s. I was taken off of it fairly suddenly when I went home. I had physical withdrawal but didn't realize it, and called my doctor with \"odd\" symptoms. He literally laughed on the phone but didn't say why, and gave me a prescription for a tranquilizer for a week or two. A few days later a friend explained it. So, did I crave opiates when I went off, or after I found out what happened? No. Would I have considered it taking it if I could somehow get it free and safely? Not even a little. I have a life to lead, thank you. What about years later when I went through chronic depression and had had personal experience or familiarity with more addictive things? No, never called to me. Does that make me better than an addict? Absolutely not, just lucky in that particular way. \\n\\nAs a baseline (possibly genetic), most people have very low to moderately low vulnerability to addiction, but more is fairly common. If someone with significant baseline potential is in a situation of chronic pain, either physical or emotional, their vulnerability goes up rapidly in proportion to the pain.\\n\\nEmotional pain can be things people don't even realize is pain because they've normalized it. Low self esteem, a bad marriage, a sense of failure, a phobia or chronic anxiety, fear about a large scale issue like climate change, or chronic hate (at the government, women, themselves, or whatever).\\n\\nWhy have addiction rates skyrocketed in the US? You don't have to be anyplace on the political spectrum, and barely awake, to know the problem. Suicide and crime rates skyrocketing. Obesity and diabetes skyrocketing. People hate social media and use it more than ever. Ever larger corporations and no privacy. The country has been gradually tearing itself apart more and more.\\n\\nThere is one and only one trigger for addiction rates climbing ever since The US Vietnam War and 60's social strife, up through the (current) pandemic and strife. One trigger: increasing chronic, individual pain. Any coincidence that the steepest climb in addictions lately is in pain medication? I think not.\\n\\nEdit: typos that was my first thought but second one being that the surface must just be very nasty to attract all flies Huh?  Are you using claims of the supernatural in a biology question?\\n\\nThere are no real cases of people teleporting or vanishing. Kind of Would like to see a video of bleach killing that stuff It's Limescale build up and cistern blocks. Oxygen does exist in water it’s dissolved…and as a fun fact most of the oxygen in our world actually comes from plants in the water but I’m getting side tracked….\\n\\nYou have to consider the structure of gills vs lungs. Lungs can get oxygen but water is heavy and you can’t easily get water out of your lungs once it’s in so breathing in and out to get enough oxygen fast enough through water is impossible to meet with the demand but water glides in and out of the gills in fish and has a much bigger surface area to gather a lot of oxygen from it. In addition to this fish also don’t need as much oxygen as humans. I agree with you here too. The data and the information is very complex.  And the hard conclusions are not completely done yet. Anyone saying the science is in, walk away. Because its not. There is a lot being learned as they study the population through this. No its an amanita and can poison you I sent the mods a request, as others probably have. One issue I realized is that those posts did not specifically violate one of the criteria for reporting, and r/biology doesn't have any rules itself. Not as far as I can tell. In fact the opposite may be true, people of exceptional intelligence are usually more socially inept and less “connected” to society. [deleted] Vodkabeer for the win! Not a beer related one, but anthrax is one that can. Changing the firsts cells of a embrio could solve that problem? Obviously, the result is quite unpredictable, but the full organism would have all mutated cells? No. I usually catch them in deeper water at the center lake edge of the Lilly pads where there are no rocks - so they don't exclusively hang out around rocks. Or Willie, the Wiarton ground hog Positive cooperativity… alters the affinity of haemoglobin for O2… 0.02% chance it’s a chance but I’m confident with those odds That's likely but the other explanation is access to sequencing. At least in the US, the Covid relief bill included funding for sequencing Covid across many patients. Sequencing in general has also gotten exponentially cheaper compared to even ten years ago. I wouldn't be surprised if the Spanish Flu mutated as quickly but sequencing wasn't invented yet so we'll never know. Considering the seriousness of Covid, there are ongoing sequencing efforts in many countries across the globe so just having more eyes on mutations will reveal mutations. I think it's hard to make a comparison simply because we are dedicating so much effort to just sequencing compared to previous viruses. Half the cells in your body are bacteria.

Thanks for the explanation. \\n\\nSpecies concepts are useful for extant organisms (for example in wildlife biology - my field), but these are always loose definitions. Usually we split extant species based on whether two populations are closely related enough to create viable offspring. But this is imperfect because of hybrids, so a combination of concepts is used. For example, lions and tigers can reproduce but they would never meet in nature because their geographic ranges don’t overlap (also this is an imperfect example because ligers have tons of birth defects). Another example would be coyotes and red wolves, but anthropogenic habitat modification has caused overlap and hybridization. Well, he does get his testosterone from ampoules I was told by a horticulturalist that you can put baking soda in water, and spray the tree.  It changes the Ph of the air plant and the kills it, but won't hurt the tree. That depends on the substance. An antibiotic? Sure, it'll eventually be metabolized and excreted. Elemental mercury? No. There is no documented correlation that I’m aware of. From the books I’ve read on the subject, intelligence is not something that is easily quantifiable. (If an IQ test is given to two people from separate countries with different cultures, the accuracy of the test is going to be way off.) I believe work has been done to remove some of the cultural bias from IQ tests but it will always have some bias.\\n\\nAdditionally, if an intelligent person with a social disorder is subjected to a social intelligence test… the results are going to be.. way off again. \\n \\nA person’s intelligence is formed by genes and how those genes interact with their environment. Identical twins who are separated at birth and raised in different families will have similar-ish IQ scores but won’t be the same. But can you accept that you could take a few out with you who didn’t wanna die? I had bags and bags and bags of those.

We would dry them then freeze them in uk Oh ok, thats good lol a few people have died of thos red once (i only know there name in danish) but u get rlly sick, and for multible days, so its not something youd wanna eat I’m more asking about the fact of how probable failure is. Not that I don’t know it happens from this. I don’t think you read what I said thoroughly. I'm more interested in research/lab than environmental or animal and the only major things I've seen are the issues regarding solely undergrad or masters and PhD job opportunities- there seems to be a bottleneck that I've seen. \\n\\nMy professor hated my proposal so I'm back to the drawing board- still googling. But thank you. Yes, it can make the one who consumes disappear. (Don't eat it it's not a magic mushroom) I should check if there was a bar nearby, maybe he’s just a little tipsy I think desensitization occurs because of overuse (e.g. desensitized penis from masturbation), whereas sensitization comes from something that indirectly triggers an over-generalized response like ptsd would. Or something like that. 1)  You’d also need remnants of the integrase that enables reverse-transcribed DNA to be integrated into the genome.\\n\\n2)  Your cells are all currently chock-full of mRNA molecules.  If reverse transcriptase randomly copied and integrated any mRNA hanging around, it would be integrating gajillion of pieces of your normal mRNA into your genome, which would be really bad for your cells.  The integrating mechanisms of viruses are often focused on both reverse transcribing and integrating their own DNA *specifically*.\\n\\n3)  If it did, all that would mean is that the cell is basically like a cell infected with real COVID (well, a part of it).  And how do you fight off cells with COVID?  Your immune system!  The cell would continue to make spike proteins, and the whole way the immune response works is by detecting cells that are making unfamiliar proteins, like the spike protein, and then killing them.  Basically, your body would kill those cells just like it would fight off any and all normal infections. That’s the stuff they make McNuggets with Just chuck it and start over.

But the Karen attitude man meet me in real life. I just like being smart and arguing online when someone says something negative. In real life I don’t give a shit unless it really affects me. I am a computer warrior. You’re right in all other sense though :( I more post these kind of questions because of my anxiety with these things, not to argue. I’d rather have other people tell me if I’ll be fine or the chance of it happening, not being told my questions are stupid if the worry I have makes sense to have. What I said had almost nothing to do with what you replied with though. I like being thorough I don’t mean to come off as rude. Simply saying “you’ll probably be fine if you don’t do it again” would’ve most likely made me feel more comfortable and I would’ve deleted the post but my anxiety and paranoia take over, eventually I stop worrying and just do it. People challenged me because they have different mindsets then me, which is also immature don’t you think? If they are so above me in the thinking sense, why bother replying at all? I’d rather have there be no replies then some boonies trying to make me feel stupid. I know it’s a stupid question but the brain has a wonderful way of mechanism. rudeness is not needed at all. That’s the only point I was trying to make, nothing else. EDIT: stay safe too bro forgot to say that. Happy Halloween Being a biologist is fine, as long as you completely stay away from Darwin's theory of evolution by means of natural selection.  \\n\\nIn general, the simple reason why it is impossible to falsify the Theory of Natural Evolution using theoretical scientific principles alone, is that it is not even a theory, not even a proper scientific hypothesis, being nothing more than a statement of belief, of a materialistic belief, as opposed to a religious belief, proclaiming blind faith in that everything must have, somehow, happened only \"naturally\", whatever that is supposed to mean. This non-theory of Natural Evolution is [NOT EVEN WRONG](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreationEvolution/comments/qha4pd/is_darwins_simpleminded_idea_of_natural_evolution/).\\n\\n. Well retroviruses cause cancer. Gene errors/mutation during cell division can also cause cancer. Certain chemicals as well as radiation can also cause mutations.\\n\\nThese mutations need to occur on proto oncogenes for the cell to become cancerous. Proto oncogenes essentially regulate cell growth. If the proto oncogene mutates where it loses regulation or provides a mechanism beneficial to cancer, it becomes an oncogene. Oncogenes are essentially cancer causing genes. He’s not dead…. He’s pining for the fjords. Thanks again, I’ll look more into it.

Also, when protein become denaturalized due heat for example, the hydrophobic parts usually become exposed. Unspecific enzimes called chaperones form weak bonds with such heat shoked proteins and 'massage' them into their more stable, biologically functional form. Chaperones are ever present in the syntetisis and (co)transport of protein, to keep them from denaturalizing and agregating, forming hidrophobic bonds among eachother, which is fatal to the cell.

I was trying to be nice to you and explain things so you could understand or develop a better sense of what's going on with COVID however, I can see that your *far superior intellect* 🙄 has lead you to have a rectal-cranial insertion issue and that no matter what I explain to you, there's just NO WAY that you're going to grasp the concept. You should probably find someone that can help you with that problem. I would suggest a proctologist... but they can be a little pricey. But really, that's OK that you don't understand. I shouldn't expect someone who wants/attempts to beat others down or even belittle others in some form or fashion in order to build themselves up to feel superior... like you're attempting to do... to grasp any concept at all, let alone understand things in the first place. I find persons, such as yourself, to be of little intellect and maturity and I firmly believe that their actions/comments, such as yours, are a direct reflection of their own parents and upbringing. I'm sure you have no idea what interventional cardiology is about or what a cardiac cath lab is and that's fine too, so in the interest of time, I'll just end things here. Have a nice day! 😃 How does it taste That's not how testosterone works.\\n\\nWill higher levels of testosterone in puberty lead to a deeper voice once puberty is finished? Probably.\\n\\nWill the amount of testosterone in your body affect your voice after puberty? Nope. Not one bit.\\n\\nYour voice is determined by physical parts of your body that have finished developing by the time you are an adult.\\n\\nIt's mostly to do with genetics unless you have a case where there is some sort of inhibited testosterone output in the individual to begin with e.g. castration. When you're body has built up an immunity to a virus, certain immune cells have developed proteins which can recognise the same viral antigens so they can quickly start destroying the virus. Those cells can also send out chemical signals (cytokines) which can induce a variety of effects on all kinds of cells. For example these can increase body temperature, increase mucous production, constrict airways etc all the common illness symptoms. But usually these pass a lot quicker as your immune killer cells can remove the infection at a much quicker rate. Pretty fucking ugly Are you under the impression that blind people are retarded? There is a hell of a lot more to the electron transport chain than just powering PSI, but I'm guessing for a highschool(?) Level question that would suffice.\\n\\nA little more depth though...PSI can actually be activated by light in the far-red wavelengths which exist in natural sunlight. The movement of electrons and breaking of water molecules across the electron transport chain is actually useful in a number of different activities such as ATP production, dissipating and storing solar energy to prevent damage (this is a main feature of photosystems, turning energy into sugars and starches by powering the calvin cycle). ATP is produced as a product through excess hydrogen from spiltting water being pushed out of the membrane through a concentration gradiant to produce ATP using ATP synthase. \\n\\nYour question is answered in the first section, but I could go on and on about the electron transport chain. Its fascinating stuff.

Species concepts are a human concept to try to discretely classify non-discrete differences in species. It's an impossible task since differences between species lie on a continuum.

I definitely think psychoactive drugs have very strong effects. I just don't think they have magic effects or connect us to anything outside our own brains. They change how our brains operate and our brains *are* us, so of course people have profound experiences on them. That doesn't mean those experiences are anything but internal. There are papers out there like this:\\nPhylogenetic study and identification of human pathogenic Vibrio species based on partial hsp60 gene sequences, Kwok, et al\\n\\nSo what you are doing makes good sense.\\n\\nThis is a puzzle. You say you have amplified hsp60 from other templates. Do you mean the same set of vibrio species in other types of samples? Or different vibrio species? Vibrio is really diverse. Your primer sequences might be ok for hsp60 from some vibrios but not for others. So check the sequences of the hsp60 primers versus the sequences of the specific vibrio hsp60s you are after.\\n\\nThis is an aside but one thing we have learned the hard way is that you cannot generally trust primer sequences from the literature. Calculate the Tm's yourself and make sure they are reasonable. Very often they are not.

The blood lost during menstruation is not direct bleeding from blood vessels or arteries.\\n\\nThe Uterus builds up a lining of enriched blood & minerals, it’s called the endometrium lining, this is what is shed during menstruation.\\n\\nThe endometrial lining is the body’s way of preparing for pregnancy. If a fertilised egg was to implant in the uterus the endometrium would be used to nourish the implanted cells ( blastocyst) which would then grow  a placenta & amniotic sac. \\n\\nThe average blood loss is 80-150 ml per week of their periods which last 3 to 7 days the average being 5 days ( some can be 9-14 days)\\n\\nWorking on averages most women lose about 80 ml per month.

Maybe if you preloaded the injection site with a translation inhibitor you could prevent it (at the cost of some severe side effects). An antisense vaccine administered immediately to the same site may reduce the total mRNA that gets translated but it won't prevent it entirely. Loading up on immunosuppressants may prevent immunity developing but the mRNA would still be translated. You ever seen a bugs life? Who you gonna call?

Don't try to memorize everything, it's a fool's errand. Try to really grasp the fundamental topics and then you should be able to draw connections between them. Some people like to use a concept map to visually see the connections between different topics. \\n\\nI don't really remember what was covered in general bio, but some fundamental topics you *might* want to become familiar with are the central dogma (DNA->RNA->Protein), cell signalling, inheritance/Mendelian genetics, natural selection, and differences between bacteria and eukaryotes. You'll want to look at your syllabus and talk to your prof to get a more tailored list for your class. \\n\\nOnce you understand the fundamentals, everything else sort of falls into place. For example, if you understand the central dogma and cell signalling, you can synthesize all of the information you need to understand basic immunology. Once you have the basics, you can fill in details that may be specific to the new topic. This way, you're only memorizing a small number of details for every topic instead of entire concepts. Also, the details are often worth less on an exam, so if you can understand the concept, the specifics are less important. I thought for sure this was a post about strawberry shortcake ice cream.

They don't have thumbs. That feeling is the urine running down your legs. Disease is a big factor. New strains of viruses and bacteria appear (or change in frequency) every year, making pathogen-resistance alleles come and go as well, almost like yearly fashion trends.\\n\\nThere are planktonic animals that make resting stages (e.g. eggs) that sink to the bottom of the pond and can stay in suspended animations for several years. In [one classic study](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06291), old resting stages of *Daphnia* (along with their pathogens) were dug out of the mud and reanimated. This is basically like using a time machine to hop back and forth and systematically cross-expose parasites and hosts from different time periods. One cool result was that the pathogens tended to be more able to infect *Daphnia* from the same year, showing that pathogens evolve to become especially good at infecting whatever genotypes are in the host population at the moment.\\n\\nWeather is another big factor. For species that reproduce fast, it can even change the population within a single year. There's a really cool study system of wild fruit flies in orchards in North America. The researchers working in the orchards have shown that allele frequencies change every year from spring to fall, as the weather becomes warmer and warmer, favoring genotypes that are good at living in warm conditions (the same alleles that are more common farther south, in fact). Then winter comes, and the population is \"reset\" as genotypes that are good at handling cold become favored instead. So it's easy to see how warm years and cold years would have a similar effect.

I’m not convinced that insects have emotions, or at least the more complex ones that allow them to analyze the emotional impact of physical pain. There are a few genera that might, but I’m not basing that on anything other than random observation. I’m no entomologist. But it’s an interesting topic. Oh, good! I thought it was nori. This it not something I am an expert at, it's just my current understanding: \\n\\n**Conjugation** is the transfer of genetic material through touch. In Bacteria this is a very small bit of naked DNA that travels through a specialized appendage. The conjugation process of the eukaryote *Paramecium* is different because like all ciliates *Paramecium* has two nuclei, a large and a small, and during conjugation the small nucleus undergoes meiosis and haploid small nuclei are exchanged with the mate. Conjugation in the *Paramecium* results in genetic variation, but does not result in additional organisms, so it is *sexual* but it is not *reproductive*.\\n\\n**Plasmogamy** is the fusion of the protoplasm of two cells (they share a cell membrane) without a nuclear fusion, and I think it is generally used to describe Fungi. My understanding is plasmogamy in fungi (resulting in the dikaryotic cell) is always ultimately followed by a delayed karyogamy. From what I can tell, the process by which *Paramecium* trades nuclei involves plasmogamy as well, but I don't see the word used in that context, so maybe there is some subtlety I am not aware of, or a preferred synonym. More on this below.\\n\\n**Karyogamy** is the fusion of nuclei.\\n\\n**Syngamy** is the fusion of two haploid gametes to form a diploid cell (it is called fertilization in some organisms). Plasmogamy and karyogamy are stage 1 and 2 of syngamy and typically progress quickly except in dikaryotic fungi.\\n\\nPlasmodial slime molds hatch as unicellular amoebas which are haploid gametes (well, sometimes...) and when two sexually compatible amoebas meet they fuse their cytoplasm (plasmogamy) and nuclei (karyogamy) together to become a diploid cell (syngamy), then repeatedly divide their nuclei without cell division to grow to a macroscopic size. To my knowledge, slimes do not perform conjugation, but I have seen that terminology used in older papers. Unfortunately it is not always clear when a scientific term is being used to describe analogous or unrelated processes. Part of the problem with terminology is words can have drastically different definitions in different fields, or even in the same field. \"Guttation\" exists in plants, fungi, and slimes but is not an analogous process, for example. \"Conjugation\" likewise describes two very different processes in bacteria and ciliate eukaryotes. And so plasmogamy, karyogamy, and syngamy may not describe identical processes in different types of organisms, or may be replaced by other synonyms. Hopefully someone with more knowledge can add to this. ask Mike tyson! .

Humans will keep evolving as long as there is a need for adaptation. Yep, you are missing another part of the story! Correct, the macronutrients are digested into the monomer units and absorbed into the bloodstream. However, the other part of the story is metabolism. Metabolism is highly complex and involves many molecular conversions to produce various molecules the body might need at any one instance.  \\n\\nA scenario where glucose might be converted to fat is eating food when your body already has sufficient energy. If the body has sufficient energy, there is no reason to break it down further to produce energy. Instead, glucose can be converted into glycogen, which is a fuel-storage molecule. \\n\\nGlycogen stores are limited, but fat stores are virtually infinite, so if you overeat, your body tends to start producing fat stores. For creation of fat stores, glucose is converted into triglycerides (basically fat) and it is stored as fat in your body. Is this a thing? Making a tea out of it and drink the pee?

Completely depends on a number of factors, but out guts can sense meal size and nutritional contents of meals and adapt to these, in order to maximise nutrient absorption. But generally when your body is in its fed state, any more food will take longer to digest which is why the only way to fairly quantify how long a meal takes to digest is on an empty stomach - ofcourse genetics and age/sex/environmental factors will also factor in.

Plants use only about 1% of absorbed water for photosynthesis. According to Law of Limiting Factors, the rate of the reaction is determined by the factor available at sub-optimal levels. Now, when water is so scarce, water stress causes the stomata to close and hence reduces CO2 availability, water stress also causes the leaves to wilt and reduces their metabolic activity. So, the effect of water as a factor is more through its effect on the plant rather than directly on photosynthesis. It seems like it’s the same person posting most of the spam. Most of his posts are being removed and it’s obviously just a troll account. Not sure why he doesn’t get banned. Yeah, flamescolipede is right. Just by virtue of the hormones being released that dictate whether gluconeogenesis or glycogenesis occur, and the energy that would be required for all of these conversions, it wouldn’t make sense for much glycogen to be produced from glucose derived from fat and protein.

I by no means have a definitive answer to this. i did! There are hundreds of thousands of compounds that kill pathogens such as HIV. The problem is that most of also kill or harm your own cells.

Well water itself is made of 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen and gases can dissolve in water as well. Look at soda drinks it has co2 in it. Water is full of it…..you could inhale water and get a tiny tiny tiny fraction of oxygen but you would not be able to keep up with the demand and water acts as an irritant in lungs because the structure isn’t suited to deal with getting oxygen from water. You can get water into lungs easy but not so much getting it out…and in order to take another breathe you need to get it out so you drown because you can’t keep up with the demand. You would need to breathe an ungodly amount of water per second to get enough oxygen and lungs just can’t do that.

Or that he’s already got a conclusion in mind and is out to DISPROVE NDEs. When we set out with a bias, it’s difficult to conduct experiments without bringing that bias along. \\nI listened to most of the 300 episodes of a NDE podcast over the last several years. I find it fascinating because everyone’s experience is unique but they all flow very similarly. Regardless of gender, race, location, culture, or creed - people have extremely similar “spiritual” experiences when they experience an NDE or psychoactive compound. Whether it’s LSD where eyes are open, or DMT with closed eyes while seeing more vividly than ever imagined…the experiences are so strikingly similar. With DMT, why would people see the same “entities” even if they’ve never heard reference of them beforehand? I’m not saying that with DMT you go off on an astral trip and meet inter-dimensional beings. But what IS happening? HOW are our humans brains so alike that we hallucinate the exact same ridiculous looking things in an altered state? How have people completely healed themselves from addictions after “meeting Mother Auyhuasca”? How is that we can consume a substance that causes us to dig into the depths of our psyche and rearrange things so that we can function more easily and understand the world more clearly? There is insurmountable evidence if more than a few scientists would study it and if it wasn’t so damn Taboo to talk about. \\n\\nIt’s precisely because it’s considered woowoo that there isn’t more in-depth research on the topic or at least not that the public is allowed to know about. It’s precisely why psilocybin, DMT, LSD, and even cannabis have been deemed schedule 1 drugs. Because it usually changes the way we see the world. It usually causes us to “wake up”, from this dumb broken system we’ve created. Why does it do that? Well, we don’t really NEED to understand the why to see that it does, regardless of our understanding. But I do believe we will understand it better someday. Whatever it is, it IS scientific and it just IS the way things are. Either we as humans have the ability to hallucinate the same experiences and exact images as strangers across the globe, or it’s a spiritual experience suggesting that there is way more than just this earthly plane of existence. It’s one of those two things and they are both really freaking cool. If science helps discover the truth, and if spirituality is also the truth, then I expect in the future we will come to accept that they complement each other well. But there is no room for religion (not even the “religion” of faith in science, because it’s still done by man’s hand) when it comes to progress. \\n\\nObserve and wonder.

Remember that at the end of the day, the known risks associated with the vaccine, and there are less than your friend seems to believe according to the research, are quantifiably far lower than Covid-19 infection, in both short and long-term. \\n\\nPlus there’s always the fact that even, “healthy,” people that don’t have to worry about being too sick not only HAVE gotten really sick and died in some cases, but even if they do fight it so well they don’t feel ill, they can still be a carrier.\\nIn being a carrier they can now spread it to someone not-so-healthy, or worse, it could mutate within the host and another variant becomes a thing.

If the planet they evolved on is similar to Earth, they might evolve very similar biology too, just from a different starting points. There are many organisms on Earth that aren't closely related, like a shark and a dolphin, that look and move in similar ways because they've adapted to a similar lifestyle. We should expect the same thing to happen when we imagine life on other planets.\\n\\n> This great difference in nature requires a Brand new term, for beings that behave in different natures.

[https://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/MariaPereyra.shtml](https://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/MariaPereyra.shtml) Gives us the slowest speed of a shotgun slug at about 335 m/s, and if we are goint to take the .2s reaction time from the first article as our standard, that means we need to be about 67m away to have any time at all to move, and we need to add on the amount of time (and therefore distance) we need to actually do the moving. A 12 gauge shotgun slug is about 18mm accross so let's say that's how far you need to move your hand to not get hit. How long does it take someone to move their hand 18mms? I have no idea and no clue how I'd find that out, but I'd bet it's not very long. Let's call it a tenth of a second, not including reaction time. So that gives us a range of about 99m. All of this is assuming, of course, that you only notice the shot when it just leaves the barrel. It doesn't take into account the tiny bits of time it takes for a trigger pull to translate into a hammer strike, and the travel down the barrel, which would give you more time.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo if someone shoots at the edge of your body, with a slow shotgun slug, from across a football field, yeah probably. Looking it up some, a 12 gauge is still accurate at that range, but with a significantly decreased amount of force, so your dodge is probably helpful, if you pick the right direction.

Alfred Binet's intelligence scale, a prototype for the Stanford-Binet IQ test, was developed with the sole purpose of identifying French children with developmental disabilities so that they could receive extra help in school. Binet's scale assigned children a mental age based on a comparison of their skills with those of \"normally functioning\" children. Binet explicitly warned against dangerous and unsupportable extrapolation of his work, such as using his tests to peg normal children and adults on a single, linear scale of immutable intelligence. Notable American eugenicist, Henry H. Goddard, eager to catalog Americans along just such a scale, promptly ignored Binet's warnings, translated the tests into English, and pushed for their wide-spread use. \\n\\n[The Eugenic Origins of IQ Testing: Implications for Post-Atkins Litigation](https://via.library.depaul.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1270&context=law-review) Same difference Oh yeah!

A lot of people died/dying because the infection rates are high. It doesn't doesn't change the fact that if you're healthy and of a median age your chances are factions of a percentage point. I’m pretty  sure its to big to be a prairie dog Thanks for your comment. 😌 The forbidden unlocks new myteries as i say for anything Ignorance usually come with Mary sue..... Not the other way. This is biology sub. That's interesting. Where I live in Aus the corvid we see is the little raven, which is the size of a UK crow. Everyone always calls them crows. It's a prime \"akshually\" moment when they do. Another 80% are made on the fly. Did the same thing with a monarch. It was on the ground and I picked it up and put it on a flower. It wasn't able to do much but I watched it for a bit then left. It felt like that was the right thing to do. Hopefully it appreciated that more than being on the ground. 1. Why are you wanting to preserve these organs?  2. Isopropyl alcohol works well. 70% I’d imagine it would destroy your mouth before you even got the chance to recognise the taste We'd all have a pretty neat shared moment and also some people would die. I don't want to kill the animal, but I do want to warn it and say: hey, I think you're pretty neat but I respect your distance. >lower chance doesn't mean no chance\\n\\nAs OP said, his friend isn't an idiot. I would assume he knows this, but what it boils down to really is how much contact you have with people, which he isn't saying.\\n\\n>The mRNA gets replicated in the cell's cytoplasm/ribosome. Your DNA is inside the nucleus of the cell and whenever something needs to be expressed, a copy of the DNA is made and then transported out of the nucleus. When it's transported out, it's the mRNA form. It's the same here, except being made in the cell's nucleus, it's introduced via a shot. As far as I know, it's the same mechanism that stops excessive expression.\\n\\nHmm.. so I'm not an expert, but this doesnt sound right. the mRNA isn't anything but a message for your body. Your body uses that message to produce proteins that the rest of your body will then fight off. I think the concern is that there's no way to control the amount of proteins your body creates so SOME people create a massive amount of proteins which end up collecting in certain parts of the body. \\n\\nWhat is \"excessive expression\"?\\n\\n>There's nothing to support that. Nothing scientific, not even theoretical. There is a bad flu going around this year, that's true though.\\n\\nI agree. Personal observation & experience is one of the absolute worst forms of scientific evidence\\n\\n>That was a surprise for me too. But the endpoints and outcomes of the protocol were approved and the trial results met the efficacy and safety standards. None of which were altered because of COVID. These are done by independent review boards and have to declare no conflicts of interest. There has also been failed mRNA COVID vaccines too, but that's less in the news. (Sanofi, Merck and GSK.)\\n\\nTechnically I believe the vaccines are still in phase 4. Correct me if I'm wrong. But to add to that, even looking at the MINIMUM timelines for each phase, it's over 2 years. I'm not sure when exactly they started, but I dont think it was October 2019\\n\\n>I can't speak on this particular local doctor's experience or anything. But the adverse events of the vaccines are readily available for you to review.\\n\\nNow this is a tough one. Again it kind of goes back to personal experiences, but at the same time, this is all so new and so much data at coming in all at once, it would be next to impossible to determine ALL of the adverse effects. Adding to that, unless science have developed a time machine, long term effects, even though extremely unlikely would be exactly impossible to know. I find these guys exoskeleton everytime i go hiking. I also agree we can’t force anyone to lose weight and be healthy that’s a choice Oh what you doing? Just having another Tuesday this weekend. You demand answers that you are not entitled to get and you behave badly if they don't write what you think they should. This is not a service you paid for but you still behave like a random Karen. Go on and damage your health but don't ask Reddit if you can do it again next week or if you will be in hospital. A plant uses water for turgidity, it occupies the interstitial cell space and creates rigidity with the increase in pressure. Water is also used as a reactant in photosynthesis and the Calvin cycle for ATP & sugar for organelle function, reproduction, structure, etc. The plant takes the stores of water from the vacuoles (along w sugar stores) when it isn’t available (drought, “forgot I owned a plant”, etc.). \\nA great deal of a plant’s mass is water and cellulose, using it for an endothermic reaction like photosynthesis requires it for interaction, but the cost is shared with solar energy. Water is abundant in the plant’s structure. It’s almost akin to your hair and skin getting dry because you’re dehydrated because your organs need that water more, the wilting, dry skin. There are also all kinds of adaptations for water regulation in plants in different climates. Evergreen plants are particularly interesting for this. Zebra mussels are not good for the environment at all despite that they could technically enhance water quality. Until they clean the water so well that it’s devoid of nutrients for other species. It is a very nasty animal That's what Google is for. /s You put your milk in the freezer?? As someone who works in the death industry, dead bodies still have rights. When they donate their body to science, they give consent. When they are autopsied, they are treated with respect and kept as whole as they can be. An autopsy also has purpose in determining cause of death. If you have sex with a dead body, there is no consent, therefore it's rape. You are raping a person's body. I don’t think your covid risk is your main problem Right you are. I saw that but didn't register that's what that was. Looks to be the right color. You already received some great answers. If you want to deepen for knowledge of protein folding, consider trying \"Foldit\", it's free and a link is here: https://fold.it/ What even is intelligence? I feel like it's very ill-defined because it's hard to quantify. There are multiple types of intelligence and within those types there are subtypes. Is general intelligence simply the average of one's different types of intelligence? I feel like intelligence may be impossible to quantify with the limited information that we can gather about someone. For example, Nickola Tesla was an \"intelligent\" individual but he was also delusional and had problems forming relationships which suggests that he had a low emotional intelligence. Therefore I would say Tesla was in fact of average intelligence, even though he was a very noteworthy individual who advanced various fields of science. Perhaps intelligence can be defined by one's contributions to society, but even that leaves a lot to be desired. Can anyone recommend a book about what intelligence actually is? Because I'd be very interested in other's thoughts on the subject. It's everyone's personal choice. Most people I know did not have this reaction. But what I will tell you is the rare bunch of us that did there is absolutely no help or acceptance whatsoever. The top people in the US in the medical industry have no fucking clue what to do. And the VICP program has left us for dead. There is no coverage whatsoever, if this were a flu shot it would be covered I would get help with my medical bills. But because it's a covid shot I've been left with nothing and I'm probably going to lose my house I mean it's possible they were in the fruit already if it was made fresh. I live just before the end of the roads in Canada, pavement isn’t really an issue here lol. Not evolutionary favorable Dude, this is a serious question, think about it, I just broke the laws of physics seriously Accidentally placed behind a centrifuge exhaust, likely blew a spore under the aluminum foil I don’t know, I guess how consciousness develops and works, where it comes from and what happens to it when your brain rots away. Oh cool!, any advantage for them having that stegosaurus-like structure on their back tho? I should check if there was a bar nearby, maybe he’s just a little tipsy He should talk to a biologist. Doctors can be pretty garbage when it comes to science. Well, I'd assume there's a lot more for them to eat down there than we really know.  The deep sea is still a pretty big mystery when it comes to what lives down there. Give it some food and if she eats it it's a girl and if he eats it it's a boy 😂 I'm sorry but my best guess would be a girl What magnitude of focus are you using? Eat them, find out True, but I was more asking if a gas as I've described it is possible to make or if that's not how the mRNA vaccines work. I think it's an assasin bug. google it and i can see the resemblance! tysm :) It’s r/biology, not r/wholesomememes Well, this is awkward. Well I’m had 3 Pfizer vaccine shots and no issues and still wearing a mask, don’t eat in restaurants, healthy no meds, occasional drink of Scotch or glass of wine with dinner. 62y.o. Male, occasional cold, never had a flu shot. During my trip to South Asia November of 2019, I did get sick right when this virus hit November 26th 2019. It take 4 months to get well! So get the Shot, you never know! Shun the nonbeliever The conscious self is a product of the biological functioning of our brains. Once your brain stops functioning, so does your consciousness. It doesn't *go* anywhere in the same way that your voice doesn't *go* anywhere because vocal chords are just no longer able to produce it. Most mushrooms containing psilocybin will stain blue when picked or pricked with a knife.

But can’t help myself A tomato horn worm of sorts? That might just be your average strawberry cake that's somehow left over there So do you just consume these things straight up? Primarily it has to do with circulation and herd immunity. Not everyone in our population is vaccinated against COVID-19, allowing the virus to continue circulating and mutating. \\n\\nFor influenza, it's herd immunity and high genetic diversity. The structure of influenza virus and it's replication cycle allow for easy mixing of it's parts and pieces to make a new influenza virus particle possible within one cycle of replication in a cell. It's your literal \"life is a box of chocolates\", because after infection there's no guarantee what will pop out. Idk what you mean. If you introduce antibodies that target self proteins, they will attach on to the cells and form a compliment system that causes cell lysis. Or they can attach on to the cells and cause immune cells to attach whatever to antibody is attached on to. Yes I understand how that works. Thanks, but why does a consciousness develop? I understand that humans need it to communicate, remember, and survive in a human sense, but why did we even evolve it? How do some cells eventually turn into a conscious organism that grows and feels, what if a consciousness doesn’t develop in a growing human? So I live in northern BC Canada. Was working in Fort st James in the bush, buddy found 2 of these and picked them, put them in a plastic strainer and placed it on a door handle above the furnace for like 4 months. They were dry as fuck. We got exxxxxtra drunk one night (like beers led to liquor which led to 19% cooking sherry drunk) and decided they now was the time to smoke some of this. We crushed it up in a weed grinder and smoked it in a glass pipe and to this day were both split on the results: he says nothing really happened in terms of getting stoned or anything, but he had awesome mental clarity and knew exactly why everything was for a few weeks.\\n\\nI coughed and coughed and coughed and fucking coughed and each time I was hacking up a lung and a half of nasty butter (I worked in construction on a really shitty job site with bad air, my buddy was an environmental guy and worked outside in the bush) and afterwards I had to analyze what I just coughed up: looked like dirt, flakes of metal maybe, awful looking black shit, more phlegm than ever. I had just purged my lungs, breathing was awesome. I was, and am convinced that smoking this cleansed my lungs.\\n\\nThis was like 5 years ago, had no nasty side effects beyond a wicked hangover that I had attributed to drinking 19% cooking Sherri. Can confirm. Got bit by one (0/10 would not recommend) and daughter used an app on her phone to identify it. wait thats not icecream Its not! This is likely S. marcescens!

This bug makes sure you only pay for what you need! Also I know this sounds bad but it’s the reality of the matter. I remember I was told by 3 people who physically work in the hospitals 1 in ER their personal accounts they say that to be the case. If you think about it tho, the agenda of telling people to get vaccinated, if that news was out no one would want to get vaccinated. You are already able to get COVID while being vaccinated. Even with this 3rd booster being nothing different. I am for vaccines I’m not anti vax but I am anti COVID vax. I see jokes aren't acceptable here.

Random question- is there a difference between a groundhog, prairie dog, and gopher? This is a really excellent article about it: https://elemental.medium.com/yes-it-is-possible-to-transplant-a-head-282d110b1cfd >**and one masturbates, does that mean it's also jacking its twin off in the process?**\\n\\nThis line of scientific research definitely deserves more long-term funding.\\n\\nScience should leave no such stone unturned.\\n\\nFinding answers to these pressing questions is merely a matter of time, Dr. Shonk. And the bite hurts like hell. We’re not doctors. Go to the doctor. Pretty sure it's mineral buildup. The world doesn't, you do. Apparently you have set an arbitrary requirement of having biology 101 to ask questions here. If that's the case, then I feel that we must have requirements to answer questions as well. Only makes sense, right? So again, what makes you so qualified to decry the questions posted here? PhD? Bachelors? Work in the sciences? Read a fucking pamphlet about birds once? Or are you actually completely unqualified so you try and make yourself look good by insulting perfectly legitimate questions? And the mRNA would have to have a specific protein on it tagging it to be allowed to enter the nucleus to even be integrated into the DNA. The covid vaccine mRNA doesn’t enter the nucleus as far as I am aware Beautiful amanita muscaria in your first photo If it somehow did, and if therefore that cell started producing spike protein from the mRNA, your immune system would kill it off for being a cell producing a foreign protein.\\n\\nHIV is a more or less unique exception because of the way it affects your immune system directly, but your problem if you have HIV isn’t the possibility of integration, it’s that you are immunocompromised and won’t be able to fight off even normal minor infections.\\n\\nIf your HIV is under control enough that you have a functioning immune system, your immune system will kill off any cell that gets the mRNA integrated and producing spike proteins. OP: Please allow me to restate your query: What is the essential role of CO2 in aerobic organisms (including humans)? Good question! Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration, which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP (a \"currency\" of life). CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells. This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where (as others have noted) it forms carbonic acid. The blood carries this to the lungs where it's released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled. Based on this, if CO2: (1) Was not generated during respiration, very little ATP would be created and the organism would die; (2) CO2 was not carried into the blood, same result; (3) If CO2 levels rise in the blood, pH would change and enzymes would not function correct, resulting in death; (4) Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled. There are more details to this, but this is the essence of what would happen, none of it good. Parasites can't even survive on their own, much less reproduce. If viruses aren't considered living for that reason, does that mean parasites aren't living?\\n\\nFire uses energy and reproduces itself as long as it has access to fuel (food). Does that make fire a living thing? This is amanita muscaria, also known as fly agaric. It is not what would typically be considered a magic mushroom and you will get sick if you eat it without special preparation Believed your observation in your life. >He is an intelligent guy and Not one of those covid deniers/conspiracy dumb\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\n\\nIt's important to understand that most anti-vaxxers, like most climate change deniers, aren't \"dumbshits\". They're average and even intelligent people who have overestimated their knowledge (including their ability to assess knowledge) in a subject area. I think if we understood that, we'd not only make wiser decisions ourselves, but also be much kinder toward others.\\n\\nYour friend doesn't need answers to technical questions. He needs to understand that science isn't about what one person thinks (him, or one doctor, or one paper) -- it operates through consensus, and the consensus on this topic seems to be very clearly that:\\n\\n1. Vaccination is important for people who live where diseases like COVID spread easily (which is most places these days);\\n2. The most commonly-used COVID vaccines are very safe; and\\n3. COVID the disease is not very safe -- and in fact, many people with minimal symptoms are showing long-term cognitive deficits.\\n\\nMy own background is in quantum physics. When I feel inclined to offer up an opinion on COVID measures, or climate models, I try to imagine how I'd feel if some epidemiologist posted to Facebook that he disagrees with my last paper, because he thinks I misunderstand the Schrödinger equation. My best guess is someone left the bathroom without washing their hands. Wheelbug, aka assassin bug. I used to have one as a pet when I was a kid. Thank u The kind u squish What I got from this it will technically work but the fillers might cause problem to health. Because I've tried b12 vape juuls and I felt an effect.\\n\\n>OP: As others have kindly, and correctly, suggested, you might want to abandon this line of inquiry. (I trained as a pharmacist and I actually understand this stuff.) When medications (including vitamins) are developed for different modes of drug delivery (oral [capsule/tablet/liquid], inhalation, parenteral, etc.) they are combined with other ingredients (excipients) that are intended for that mode of delivery only. Frequently, the active ingredient represents only a small portion of the delivery form. If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode (e.g., inhalation or injection), he/she is placing substances that were not intended for that organ into one's body. In the lungs, that can cause granulomas to develop and in the blood, clots that could reach vital organs. Also, the salt of the active agent might not be as soluble as needed, regardless of any misguided use of a nebulizer to make it so. Please do not consider putting anything in your body (or anybody else's) in a manner that it was not intended, there are enough problems in the world already, and you don't need to add to them.\\n\\n1. If the B vitamin liquid supplement is a sublingual how does your body break off the EXcipients/fillers that are attached to the molecule vitamins in just the mouth? Simply with saliva? So can you use it to break down and separate the fillers from the B vitamins?\\n\\n2. All vitamins are small molecules by default but because the supplement contains fillers which attached themselves to the vitamins because of the procedure cause it to become and big sized one collective. If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms, so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you won't be able to use it.\\n\\n3. So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms (vitamins and fillers in supplement) into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb, but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins, so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air? Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesn't recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size. Therefore it has to go trough the gut system. But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs (similarly to the gut) can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers? I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isn't found in the body naturally. But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size? If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally, then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is. When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big. therefore, the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air, so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air, your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally. or exepection Have public schools failed our children?

So I would be in favor of correcting that gene defect. Came here to say mostly the same thing you did, but your part 3 did give me an idea. If we could utilize reverse transcriptase to make an mRNA vaccine that inserted the spike protein code into our genetic code, then our cells could regularly produce antigens, possibly acting as our own \"passive boosters\" to viruses. Now, yes there are a lot of specific nuances to this idea, but that's what research is for, right? Some issues to consider: how to ensure that the new antigen gene gets put in a safe spot of our genome (not splitting important genes); ensuring regular but not too active transcription; would it lead to a sort of \"tolerance\" to the antigen, causing our bodies to no longer react to the antigen. Probably much easier said than done, but hey, it's an idea. Looks like a Sun Conure. They can only be sexed by surgery at a veterinary clinic. Unless she starts laying eggs. Then you’ll know! Old!

I agree it's interesting, but you should take a lot of those reports with a grain of salt. The more we study things, the more we find there are natural explanations for them.\\n\\nHere is a [great post](https://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/studying-near-death-experiences/) from a neurologist on NDEs (excerpt below)\\n\\n>That NDEs occur is not controversial – many people report remembering experiences around the time of cardiac arrest from which they were revived. Typical experiences include a sense of floating outside of one’s body, even looking down upon oneself and the events going on. Some people report a bright light, and others report “passing over” and being greeted by deceased loved-ones. The experience is often peaceful or euphoric, which contrasts to the way people feel when they eventually wake up. Surviving a cardiac arrest takes its toll and is not a pleasant experience.\\n\\n>The question is not whether or not people have such experiences – the question is how to interpret them. Just as even the most rigorous skeptic does not question that people see UFOs, but rather what the UFOs likely are.\\n\\n>The burden of proof for anyone claiming that NDEs are evidence for the survival of the self beyond the physical function of the brain is to rule out other more prosaic explanations. This burden has not been met.\\n\\n>Neuroscientists are piecing together plausible explanations for each of the components of the NDE. The sensation of floating outside one’s body can be reliably induced by suppressing that part of the brain that makes us feel as if we possess our bodies. The experience is identical to that reported by those who have had an NDE. This experience can be replicated by drugs or magnetic stimulation. There are even reports (I have had one such patient) of people who have a typical NDE experience during seizures. The bright light can be explained as a function of hypoxia (relative lack of oxygen) either to the retina or the visual cortex. Any everything else is simply the culturally appropriate hallucinations of a hypoxic brain. This is the class that made me a microbiology major! I loved this class when I took it at my college. Whoa!

Shove it up your ass and see what happens I mean I would take care in what is really being said by various sources; the most accurate take would probably be neutral on the issue at hand and would not be showing any bias; i.e. \"there are a number of hypotheses for why these behaviors occur, and there is at least some evidence which agrees with each; however, this is an area which requires more study.\" \\n\\nA few of these \"sources\" are not scientific sources at all and a few seem to indicate bias to me, those included; \"bias\" does not necessarily mean homophobia (though it is in some cases), when I say that I mean for example \"animals aren't intelligent\" or \"they don't really know what they're doing\" type arguments. \\n\\nResearch shows many are more intelligent than we thought, and many are certainly widely understood to be intelligent enough that you can't act like your conclusion encompasses all non-human species (great apes are kind of notorious in this discussion, especially bonobos). I'm not an expert, but I'm pretty sure the body produces blood on demand. That's why you can donate blood several times a year without eventually dying is it missing it's jaw? 1) Technically, you can do anything you want, but I would rather not get involved in the ethics of advertising the sale of bodily fluids. So, to answer \"people can well breast milk for a high price for a short time after getting vaccinated and advertise it as having antibodies?\", sure, they could, but whether or not it's entirely accurate or safe without proper testing, remains to be seen. That's a whole other rabbit hole that I'd rather not comment on.\\n\\n2) No. For the long explanation, newborns have special receptors on their intestinal lumen/lining that allow for the absorption of special nutrients, including antibodies, from the breast milk of the mother. These receptors allow for proper absorption and circulation of intact antibodies from the mother into the child. After a period of time with aging, these receptors go away in the adolescent/adult, so drinking breast milk from a recently vaccinated woman would not be beneficial in fighting COVID-19 in the adult patient. He doesn't want to and is looking for excuses. All the answers he wants are easily available, he never looked and prefers to listen to gossip. \n"

an emergent property of the nervous system As a psychiatrist— I find that definition limits us to a mind body separation which is a fairly outdated and binary concept The error rate depends on the technology used Typically more than one technology are used to fill in gaps for whole genome sequencing while highly accurate technologies are used for shorter sequences ie individual genes CRIPSR isn’t to my knowledge being used all that much to look at identifying the underlying genetic causes of disorders but rather fixing them on a molecular level However the studies that do this generally use CRISPRmediated gene knockoutknockdown experiments Looks like baby gator skull… Eyes do seem a bit large though Oh thanks I just like bugs this isn’t my branch of study or anything \\n\\nBut I’ve been talking to people who do study Entomology and they’re saying it’s unlikely a young adult Virologist here Your child is not vaxxed but temporarily protected Your wifes breast milk should have antibodies from her being recently vaccinated and those antibodies can be ingested by your child and provide temporary immunity However once your wifes antibody surge returns to normal levels the temporary immunity wont be as potent Only through vaccination can your child be protected in the long term I hope this makes sense I don’t know but you’re a braver man than I I agree The emended genus definition for Pectinatus Juvonen and Suihko 2006 is consistent with OPs morphology included below for interest It looks like this genus contains both catalasepositive and catalase negative species Its worth noting that the agar that OP used NBBA states in the user manual that it is Nutrient media for the detection of Beerspoiling microorganisms esp Lactobacilli Pediococci Pectinatus and Megasphaera in filtered beer samples\\n>Pectinatus [Pectina′tus L part adj pectinatus combed bacteria]\\n\\n>Cells are nonsporeforming slightly curved to helical rods 0·4–0·9×2–50 μm or more with rounded ends and a Gramnegative cell wall They occur singly in pairs or rarely in short chains Cells are usually motile by means of comblike flagellation which emanates from only one side of a cell Cadaverine or putrescine is found in the cellwall peptidoglycan Organisms are strictly anaerobic mesophiles with fermentative metabolism Glucose and fructose are mainly metabolized to acetic and propionic acids H2S and acetoin and occasionally minor amounts of succinic acid are produced Cells do not synthesize cytochrome oxidase desulfoviridin or indole hydrolyse arginine or gelatin or reduce nitrate The GC content of the DNA is 38–41 mol The species of the genus can be separated from each other by using various genetic and phenotypic criteria Isolated from beer and brewing processes The type species is Pectinatus cerevisiiphilus Lee et al 1978 emend Schleifer et al 1990 Sure but have you been to Orinda You have to throw out all of your fun before going into town thanks bro Yes

chemisty and I could immediately find work in chemistry After a year I went to grad school and finished a PhD Environmental Sciences and Resources Biology throughout which my chemistry background was very useful For almost 22 years Ive been working in biotech designing antisense oligos assisting customers with experimental design designing new products contributing to marketing and advertising and troubleshooting production processes The chemistry background has been an invaluable foundation for my mostlybiological career You can go usually go farther faster with a chemistry background I

in WC and we have all sorts of cool shit for California The bug posts are so annoying Isnt there a sub for insects and random species identification And the bite hurts like hell 1 I dont know much about sublingual liquid forumulations but I believe that the active ingredient would need to either already be in solution or be delivered as a micronized powder in suspension In the latter case the smaller particles would presumably dissolve readily\\n2 The vitamins you refer to are not attached to the excipients they are aggregated together which is a physical phenomenon Think of the vitamin as a marble being placed in a cup with smaller beads the excipient then add some flour and water and the resulting clump is analogous how the drug is formulated That said yes the vitamin will release from the clump and enter the bloodstream\\n3 I dont understand your third question A nebulizer works by converting a liquid or suspension containing the vitamin into a fine mist which is inhaled into the lungs If its a suspension the particulates are extremely fine and when deposited in the lungs allow the vitamin to cross the alveolar and fine bronchial membranes into surrounding tissues and the bloodstream Where was the hive at And then there’s ignorance without compassion Thanks for reminding me i though it was neapolitan with no chocolate part for a second b4 i read the title 🤢 Looks like an Aminta so yes  Beautiful mysterious creatures unfortunately it is probably at the end of the life cycle thanks for trying to help tho we need more people like you in the world ❤️ Why does it feel like Im doing your homework For your body to use them it needs to be broken down to individual atoms or molecules not particles You are probably better off posting to rChemistry because at this point that is what you are brushing up against You do realize that at these scales pretty much all chemistry including all your biological processes are powered by random chance of molecules bumping into one another The sheer numbers of atoms and molecules involved allow this to be possible That is also why most life relies on water because it is an excellent solvent which facilities the transportation of molecules leading to said chance encounters for interactions to occur It is an oversimplification but the chemistry in question can generally be seen as a microscopic mechanical process Molecules be they vitamins drugs or even parts of cells in your body fit together perfectly like 3D puzzle pieces when interacting Therefore said interactions arent going to be possible with particles nomatter how small until they are broken down into individual molecules Again at this point you are really talking chemistry more than biology As for PH levels affecting absorption rates yes it plays a huge role but again this will be dependent upon the vitamin in question Yennifer is the only crow thats beautiful to me Literally everywhere Its a pastime of ours You cant see viruses in a

reversetranscribed DNA to be integrated into the genome\\n\\n2 Your cells are all currently chockfull of mRNA molecules If reverse transcriptase randomly copied and integrated any mRNA hanging around it would be integrating gajillion of pieces of your normal mRNA into your genome which would be really bad for your cells The integrating mechanisms of viruses are often focused on both reverse transcribing and integrating their own DNA specifically\\n\\n3 If it did all that would mean is that the cell is basically like a cell infected with real COVID well a part of it And how do you fight off cells with COVID Your immune system The cell would continue to make spike proteins and the whole way the immune response works is by detecting cells that are making unfamiliar proteins like the spike protein and then killing them Basically your body would kill those cells just like it would fight off any and all normal infections Because you’re not allowed to have anything negative to say

back if u r insecure It should be referring to the solute concentration after dilution refer to the second paragraph on the sheet Buddy it is okay if you have low IQ I think the word youre looking for is altruism and act of compassion towards another unrelated organism with little to no regard for the risk to oneself or compensation of such an act In humans it is evident although there is an ongoing debate on whether an act can be truly altruistic given that on a subconscious level it is almost exclusively beneficial to be compassionate towards others that is in most circumstances being kind to others earns us positive endorphins a feeling of satisfaction when you help someone you dont know which is the pinnacle of evolution in social animals We are hard wired to sacrifice for others due to the parentoffspring bond which is so strong it extends to other potentially unrelated people and even other species The same can be said for cetaceans which are not far behind us in terms of social evolution Although they may not be aware or even capable of being aware of a potential payoff for helping a distressed swimmer at their own risk although they likely do have these cognitive capabilites at least where it concerns helping unrelated members of their own species their social cognition is also hard wired to aid conspecifics and other creatures humans seals other whales based on their cognitively advanced awareness of present danger and the panicked behaviour of the organism in distress Again the payoff is positive endorphins rather than lets say the abstract idea of Ill scratch your back if you scratch mine Im not sure this meta study has been done but I would hypothesise that the greater sociality of a species the greater frequency of acts deemed to be altruistic will be seen in that species which simply means the more social an animal is the more it will behave in a selfless manner towards nonrelated organisms But again there is a reward whether youre aware of it or not that being positive endorphins One is certainly aware of the positive effect these endorphins have on the body and mind and being aware of this benefit thus calls into question the selfless nature of putting yourself at risk for others Its much like that episode in friends when Phoebe lets a bee sting her I hope that attempts to answer your question Ask Mike Tyson yourself In

in your thought processes Well the livingunliving status of viruses is still up for debate but thats for another thread But in any case evolutionary processes are not guided by want or any kind of volition It is simply that the more effective at its strategy a virus is the more descendants it will produce which will carry its genetic material etc This is also true for our evolution or that of plants and amoeba\\nAlso Ill point out that viruses tend to evolve towards a more commensal relationship with the host with a decrease of virulence where the virus wont kill it or harm it too much But I believe its a tendency and not a rule though\\nHope that helps feel free to ask questions Cursed Banana slices It will work for sure Lowes or Home Depot sells a new flapper plug for like 2 Everyone

dinoNOOO Theres a couple of reasons first the common cold isnt a single virus its not even a single family of viruses so having immunity to one causal virus just reduces the number of common cold causing viruses that can infect you Another is that not all viruses are remembered equally Corona viruses in particular is one the body had poor memory for and your immunity will generally wane within 6 to 9 months of infection just in time to pick it up again the next winter This is why those in high risk categories are getting booster shots for Covid 19 to boost that waning immunity Third is mutation this is seen with the influenza virus most notably hence the yearly flu vaccine where educated guesses are made to try and predict how it will mutate and then produce new vaccines on that prediction Fourth would be youre immune system is compromised perhaps you were recovering from a severe illness or on immunosuppressant or had viral infection like measles which wipes out your immune memory Nice try As humans were a bit used to thinking of childhood as a brief period and adulthood as long but for most insects its the other way around Your dragonfly friend was a larva living underwater somewhere snacking on bugs and small fish and tadpoles and growing bigger for as long as a year or more Its adult phase when it had wings and flew around and made babies was just the final

bags were made of Other ingredients include various kinds of alcohols  methanol ethanol propanol  we encounter these in everyday life They all have noticeable odours but in low concentration the vapour isn’t something to worry about Ethanol is the alcohol we find in wine beer and spirits the other alcohols are not something you should drink Propanol is in rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizer Methanol is used in fuel  but methanol is poisonous You can find it in ‘moonshine’ that home made illicit booze Drinking it is very risky blindness even death But a faint smell of methanol is not really something to worry about If you look at page 10 of that safety data sheet it shows the toxic limits but it takes some interpretation Napthalene is toxic at 250ppm parts per million less than

molecules to reproduce itself build itself Scientist do not yet know what the smallest amount of specifically shaped atoms  complex molecule or molecules are able to selfreplicate Many scientists believe that the premordial type of molecule was likely RNA very similar to DNA The theory is called The RNA World Hypothesis It was developed by the scientific mentors of Jennifer Doudna who recently won the Nobel Prize for CRISPR gene editing She created a feasibly self replicating RNA consisting of a few thousand atoms but its unlikely this was or is the smallest amount of atoms that can self replicate In short still unknown Regarding your question about concentration\\n\\nRead the different ways to calculate concentration here [httpswwwthoughtcocomdefinitionofconcentration605844]httpswwwthoughtcocomdefinitionofconcentration605844 Its easiest to understand the concentration of water in water using mass  or volume  Two solutions of distilled water are each 100 water so the concentration in each is just 100 by mass or volume It might be a little counterintuitive because youre used to considering the concentration of something else like salt or sugar in water But if two solutions are both pure water then their concentration of water is the same\\n\\nAs for your second point I really hate the way people explain diffusion in school and it tripped me up for a while too The better way to understand diffusion is like this theres no force pulling molecules towards an area of low concentration Each molecule is moving completely randomly bouncing off of things and getting thrown around by its neighbors It doesnt know what a concentration is and it doesnt care But if you have a setup with a semipermeable membrane like this\\n\\n A | B\\n x x x x | \\n x x x x x | x \\n x xx xx x |\\n\\nWhich is more likely that any one of the 15 Xs crammed into side A will hit the membrane and cross into side B or that the one lonely little X on side B will find its way to side A Clearly there are more Xs on side A so there are 15 times more opportunities for a particle to cross into side B And we say that the solution diffuses into side B though each molecule in it is moving completely randomly\\n\\nWhen you have the same number of objects on one side as the other theyre still moving around just as fast but now theres an equal likelihood of a molecule randomly moving in either direction So we say our net diffusion is zero even though the molecules are crossing the boundary at the same rate > spirit of this sub\\n\\nClassifications in Biology range from the extremely specific to the incredibly vague For example it could identify a young male Blue Tit as well that or simply a member of the animal kingdom Each name and group is derived from the group before it and could not exist without a predecessor\\n\\nTherefore if we do not have vague classifactions of nature we have ignored what our specific names were built off of we have disrespected the history and hard work of many a biologist before us\\n\\nAs such since many other subs have the specifics down on naming things better than us already it should be up to us to give vague classifications for the very sake of biology As long as we remain technically correct we will have likely fulfilled this goal\\n\\nSo it could be said after jumping through many mental hoops that it is in the spirit of this sub to be vague about this as long as the other ID subs exist\\n\\nNot that anyone much cares it seems There a numerous examples of

a virologist immunologist entomologist a new worried father what have you shortly after your immune system is stimulated You would therefore after a vaccination booster get a surge or sudden increase in circulating antibodies In this case for a booster it would be IgG antibodies over IgM or even in this specific case of a pregnantpostpartumbreastfeeding mother IgA antibodies as its present in her bodily fluids but I digress\\n\\nThen after a period of time the antibodies go down to almost undetectable levels Theres vast variations in the populations and within individuals so saying that they go to 0 is not entirely accurate In this day and age with there being no herd immunity vaccine hesitation and resistance etc its quite possible any particular person may have some level of SARSCoV2 antibodies circulating at any point in time Thats why theres baseline with testing depending on the type of test done and what has been used as a control to establish that test Ive worked in a variety of laboratories and for instance theres one influenza variant lets call it variant A that if your antibody titer is 18 or higher you are considered immune to that virus 1 portion of your serum had enough antibodies present to bind to virus when mixed with blood and diluted at a ratio of 18 But lets also say theres another influenza variant called B thats a bit more funky so we consider a titer of 116 or 132 protective Or better yet its an H5based influenza virus in which case its highly debated if HAI testing is even a good determinant of protective antibody response at all But again I digress\\n\\nI hope this answered your question somewhat Don’t worry I’ll block you now Umm yes The damn squirrels throw acorns at me and the dog every time I take him for a walk This should help you

example was first noticed in India in 2020 same time as everything else happening The issue is that we dont know until the research happens not to mention it mutates exactly how all other respiratory viral illnesses do We just didnt ever have it so we didnt know the different types much like how theres 4 strains of the flu with many variations of the 4 strains Also its mutation rate means nothing

of countries the Netherlands Portugal Czech republic Switzerland is not illegal to consume any kind of methamphetamine for personal use regardless on the reason why you are using it But usually at least some methylamphetamines are categorized as controlled substances and altough consumption might not be per se illegal possession and sale surely are There are also several methamphetamines which are perfectly legal in almost all countries and which you can buy in any pharmacy as OTC pharmaceuticals eg levomethamphetamine and dpseudoephedrine but those ones are not really psychoactive so you are not going to get any of the desired effects by smoking them And returning to your science project as others have said only participants can take the drug not the ones testing its effects If you want to volunteer as a subject in any clinical trial involving a particular methamphetamine you can surely apply and if youre lucky you are gonna get to use the drug but I still find unlikely that they will let you smoke crystals of methamphetamine hydrochloride as other routes of administration are far more likely for example orally or intravenously In every case whatever you do just be responsible and apply every harm reduction strategy you can Methamphetamine just like any other pharmaceutical is not a joke and you should be extremely careful while handling it if you dont desire to

lengthens the telomeres of chromosomes after cell division During prenatal development when our cells are dividing super fast telomerase is active But pretty much immediately after birth it gets turned off in most of the body If it randomly gets turned on in some cell in the adult body it can cause cancer since long telomeres mean potentially uncontrolled division In Alaska we’re taught from

immune response against yourself by introducing a protein that’s already there Eat them all see what happens Maybe its a jackdaw Shut up and take my money MVP over here I think the bird predictors would have seen this coming Most undergrads want precalc for anything beyond that a university is generally a much better place to learn it than in high school Once you get into integrals and anything beyond simple calc a lot of HS teachers can be out of their depth Of course this depends on the system in your country but I feel it would hold pretty generally I personally took precalc and stats in high school and most of the calc we learned wound up being useless after a week in university A few things You might have negative frequency dependent selection going on where the least common phenotype reflected by genotype is going to have an advantage in the environment For instance if a prey animal such as a vole were to have a light and a dark phenotype a predator might recognize the more common phenotype as food So if the light voles are more common foxes may be keeping a closer eye out for light phenotypic voles recognising them as good prey This would reduce the light causing alleles due to increased predation and the dark genotypes would increase their proportion of the population until this scenario is reversed This cycle continues perpetually \\n\\nHowever this is unlikely to be strictly yearly as it usually takes more time than a year for an entire populations allele frequencies to change enough to make a large enough difference to alter fitness \\n\\nMore likely on a year to year basis the population is experiencing fluctuating selection where alternating conditions in the environment favor one genotype over another Perhaps a plant species is living in an area that is flooded every other year and the two phenotypes in the population are plants that do much better in the dryer year and one that does better in the wet year If there is no flooding the drytype genotype will have more fitness leading to more offspring and therefore more dry alleles in the population however in flooded years the wetliking phenotype will do better and propagate the wet genes [deleted] Is there some quiral compound that is used as a defence mecanism Like secuestring the active site of the native enantiomer Maybe try rfitness Could have been poisoning by bug spray

projects wild guess would be 2 and I only say that because atoms on their own are just matter with the number of neutrons protons and electrons dictating the type of matter but once 2 atoms combine

Most oral medications including vitamins must be produced in a way that ensures a uniform product that consistently delivers the intended dose to the body One of the steps in manufacturing involves creation of granules containing the active ingredient and one or more excipients such as binding agents When the medication is taken the tabletcapsule dissolves in the stomach and then the granules dissolve releasing the active ingredient This is typical for a watersoluble drug but lipidsoluble drugs do a similar thing Dont nebulize your vitamins This is a very dumb idea unless you want lung

Theyrenot cubes of you are wondering I am in med school and love anatomy hence why my boyfriend gave them to me so seeing the fully intact organs I find them beautiful and wanted to keep them > apples to oranges\\n\\nBut you can still compare them thats one long orgy Dammit I cant predict anything The OP told me they didn’t need to support their claim of what was “proven” because a simple Google search would do it for me I Googled because that’s what OP claimed I needed to do and I showed the mixed data I got\\n\\nAnd second Malone is a scientist who did some of the initial seminal work on mRNA vaccine technology in his early years He did not invent the entirety of what we have today  there are a ton of pieces to it building on more than just his work\\n\\nYes he does have that opinion Other scientists and many more of them have other opinions Those opinions involve largescale research and published clinical trials with this vaccine technology Has Malone demonstrated a higher clinical incidence of vaccine adverse effects than anyone else Has he shown that hospitals are overflowing with people having negative vaccine reactions and dying from them If he’s shown this in a rigorous way as others have done for their claims as opposed to just stating theories he should publish it and he’ll be easily searchable\\n\\nWhatever Malone’s position it’s abundantly clear that unlike OP stated Dr Malone has not “proven” that infectioninduced immunity is better than vaccineinduced immunity If you have a peerreviewed paper published by Malone in a scientific journal “proving” that as OP claimed you are welcome to share it This is a hard problem to answer precisely It is sometimes called the protein folding problem However there are physical tendencies and regularities that can be used for understanding\\n\\nFirst and probably easiest regularity is that the core of a protein the part not exposed to the water solvent is predominately hydrophobic One way to think of it is that water don’t want those aliphatic chains messing with the nice hydrogen bonds so amino acids like leucine isoleucine methionine phenylalanine are pushed away from contact with water \\n\\nConversely many polar amino acids like glutamate lysine end up at the exterior of the protein in contact with the water solvent\\n\\nMinor note there are membrane proteins that cross cell membranes These membranes are hydrophobic in nature and in those cases the regularities above are inverted But I limit myself to discuss proteins that are mostly in contact with water inside and outside cells\\n\\nHowever the backbone of a protein contains polar groups It can be attractive sometimes to bury a polar amino acid sidechain in the core too and to bind with the buried polar groups For reasons I will not get into here buried hydrogen bonds can be very strong If you find a protein with a buried hydrogen bond you can expect that to be an important bond to stability or possibly function of said protein Sometimes you can even have buried “salt bridges” where a negatively charged sidechain like glutamate is interacting with a positively charged sidechain like lysine and those will be quite strong\\n\\nThere are a few specialcase amino acids Proline for example has an odd structure in that its sidechain binds to the backbone twice not just to the alphacarbon Proline tends to “bend” the backbone differently from other amino acids Therefore if you have one or several nearby prolines in the sequence that very likely corresponds to a place where the protein forms a loop in terms of its tertiary structure\\n\\nAnother special case is glycine since it lacks a sidechain entirely That leads to a more flexible backbone \\n\\nAnother special case is histidine This is an amino acid that has a pKa close to physiological pH That means that by modest changes to the environment this amino acid can flip between uncharged to charged You can think of histidine as a way to functionally encode a pH switch That means histidines tend to show up in places where some such functionality is needed Great example is the FcRn binding of antibodies\\n\\nAnother special case is cystine This is the only amino acid that can form a covalent bond between sidechains So called sulphur bridges can form between pairs of cystine sidechains Covalent bonds are strong and add a great deal to protein stability So again if you see cystine amino acids in the sequence they are often going to become part of sulphur bridges with other cystine amino acids in the sequence of with other chains in a quaternary structure\\n\\nA key point in all this is that the tertiary structure is determined by interactions between pairs or higher of amino acids You can therefore never fully say what one particular amino acid sidechain will end up in the tertiary structure You can say some things to be more or less likely based on the regularities above However to say anything with more certainty requires more careful analysis \\n\\nLet me take one special observed regularity The so called [leucine zipper]httpsenwikipediaorgwikiLeucine_zipper is a motif wherein leucine appears at every seventh sequence position for some stretch This can be explained as it leads to very favourable dimerization of two helices such that the leucine sidechains “zip up” very well together recall they are highly hydrophobic So if you happen to see a handful of leucine amino acids spaced seven positions apart in the sequence you might guess that’s going to be part of a tertiary or quaternary structure of a leucine zipper\\n\\nThere are other such regularities However they are rarely perfect and rarely sufficient to figure out tertiary structures from sequence alone For that you need to consider more relations that are more complex that these types of rulesofthumb I’ve outlined above \\n\\nIt is also noteworthy that for most proteins their tertiary structure is stable under single mutations say you replace one amino acid with another So again one single amino acid sidechain change often not always does not change the higherorder structure Some tertiary structures are extremely stable under most mutations The [immunoglobulin domain]httpsenwikipediaorgwikiImmunoglobulin_domain is a good example of a higherorder protein structure that appears in many quite distinct proteins and nowadays one can predict if a sequence will form such a structure pretty well because of certain highly conserved features in the sequence\\n\\nAnyways this can go on for long and structural biology is the place to study this in more detail Your teacher’s hesitancy to provide details is understandable since it is not an easy problem with a big body of research literature and without simple or certain rules if you go beyond the most basic regularities You shouldnt be helping OP or anyone posting similar questions They are looking for encouragement for stupid and dangerous self medication regiments

Ymmv obv Why Please do explain to be clear its a dry ski slope and not snow to be clear Maternal antibodies are passed to newborns in breast milk These antibodies are passive  in that they were not produced in the newborn due to immune system stimulation They will be protective but they do not infer longterm immunity such as a vaccine or natural infection can Interestingly they will interfere with the immune systems ability to mount a response to a vaccine  which is part of the reason why new babies need so many boosters of vaccines In short the answer is no a baby will not have a vaccine reaction due to nursing but they will receive antibodies from the maternal immune response I don’t know Mary Sue\\n\\nEdit I am ignorant of Mary Sue Thanks for the info Thatll surely help me Well the

chain with “like” charges are going to repel while opposite charges can form an ionic bond through the transferring of electrons\\n\\nMore specifically amino acids with polar side groups are hydrophilic waterloving and tend to be on the surface of the protein through it’s interaction with water making it soluble in aqueous solutions In contrast amino acids with nonpolar side groups are hydrophobic water hating and aggregate in the core of the protein itself\\n\\nHope this helps  Im a high school bio teacher and have my masters in bio 🥼 Guess people see the comment as advocating

of new taxonomy though Life on Earth can be divided into domains and kingdoms and so on but those are all based on sharing a single common ancestry If we find something on another planet that looks a lot like a bacterium but we can show that it didnt evolve from the same ancestor as our bacteria we cant formally call it a bacterium It has to be put into a brand new domain thats specific to that planet\\n\\nIf in a hypothetical future weve found life on four or five different worlds each of them appears to have emerged separately not from some kind of panspermia event and all life on each respective planet shares a common local ancestor as is the case on Earth that means you have one evolutionary tree of life per planet So tree of life basically becomes a new taxonomic level above

small portion of the delivery form If someone tries to retroactively deliver a drug by a different mode eg inhalation or injection heshe is placing substances that were not intended for that organ

would not survive in just any environment That doesnt mean they arent living things I don’t know if they have little or none but I’m not sure how it matters in terms of the animal generating energy > spiders are harmless as well in the UK yet they terrify me\\n\\nFalse Widow bites hurt like hell FYI But the countless stories of people “floating out” however they choose to describe it of their body when dead and being able to observe and hear what’s going on in other rooms or at significant distances from their bodies is something curious People have been able to relay conversations or describe what was happening while they were pronounced dead when they by all known scientific reasoning should not have been able to do that People have met other family members that they had never met in real life describe them to living family members who confirmed identity with pictures There’s a lot of detail in these experiences that give glimpses into something “more” not saying it’s God or whatever just that it’s worth looking into with an open mind \\n\\nI’ll admit that at first I found NDE stories comforting after leaving religion bc I have had personal experiences that lead me to believe that there is more I felt it couldn’t be the Judeo Christian god that’s all such nonsense and bonkers I’ve come to the personal conclusion that it doesn’t matter what we believe only how we live honestly even that doesn’t “matter” Whether there’s something after this life or not we DO have this tangible life right now and it’s what we should put all our focus toward Not wondering or fearing what happens after this life that’s silly and wasteful So now I just find the NDE topic and the study of psychedelics pretty fascinating Because it IS a glimpse into our brains and psychology Whether it’s spiritual or physical it’s interesting either way Effector cells are basically the activated cells that carry out a specific function in response to a stimulus Take B cells  when activated by T cells they differentiate into effector plasma cells which are the ones that actively secrete the antibodies The effector T cells would be the CD4 Helper T cells and the CD8 cytotoxic T cells Once an infection has been dealt with sone of the B cells  T cells remain around afterwards incase the same infection ever occurs again These are the memory cells and these are not really effector cells Thank

don’t understand the basic foundational principals of the theory of evolution Evolution has no end goal just random mutation and selection pressures What I tried to explain is that it is an integral part of how the body works The systems it takes part in derive from its essential role in metabolism if that need was not there it wouldnt exist The carbonic anhydrase component is the best example of this if no CO2 were present that buffering system would not have evolved and if it were suddenly absent the organism would not survive FYI a very small amount of CO2 is expelled by hemoglobin but thats not sufficient for survival I think k it was a joke guys calm down Can you just say youre talking about the mRNA vaccines so these people can actually answer you properly I have a dog and these

however this is not recommended as fresh caps contain ibotenic acid  a brain lesioning agent Although if this was a single occurence i doubt youd have much if any damage from eating them The right way of preparing them is to place them in an oven at about 175 for 40 minutes to decarboxylate the ibotenic acid into muscimol the desired psychotropic compound This is the same process for preparing cannabis to make edibles At that point 20 grams eaten will be a very strong psychotropic trip You can also smoke them to get effects without risk of ibotenic acid poisoning Lets say an enzyme is

placement and toe count along with spinneret pedipalp of the male and ventral abdomen of a female characteristics help identify the particular species These last two are usually used by experts though

They are two different words and have two different meanings I was clarifying their meanings since the OP said English is not their first language \\n\\nAlso people in the scientific community do care about the meanings of these words Here are a few posts you may enjoy

Ill attempt to answer your question in the most straight forward and simplistic way I can Ill avoid getting too detailed so you can wrap your mind around the basic concept of viruses \\n\\n\\n\\nViruses dont want anything or have goals motives desires or intent Viruses exist to only to replicate \\n\\nViruses are completely reliant on a host to do the replication for them \\n\\nVirulence is a human created term to categorize the severity of illness caused by a viral infection \\n\\nSome viruses cause little if any ill effect on the host\\n\\nSome viruses cause the host to fall ill for prolonged periods of time \\n\\nSome viruses can infect a host for the duration of the hosts life \\n\\nSome viruses can cause severe acute illness followed by death \\n\\nSome viruses infect a host just once but leave the host forever scarred or with significant longterm health issues \\n\\nMany viruses are host specific meaning they can only infect a certain species \\n\\nViruses infect very specific cellular systems within the host species \\n\\nThoes infected cells are hijacked by the viral genetic information and given instruction to replicate the virus over and over and over again until the infected cell bursts with millions of copies of the virus \\n\\nThe replicated viral copies quickly infect the adjoining cells and the process repeats until either all the cells are destroyed or the immune system of the host gets the viral invasion under control \\n\\nMutations during the replication process drive the evolution and success of viruses \\n\\nThe more the virus is able to replicate the higher the probability of a mutation occurring \\n\\nMutation are caused by errors made in the replication process Nearly all mutations are unsuccessful deadends for the virus \\n\\nSome chance random mutations may make the virus more successful \\n\\nA beneficial mutation may give a virus ability to replicate at a greater rate in greater numbers infect different cellular systems or even infect other species\\n\\nWhen a virus mutates to infect a new species it becomes a novel virus for the new hosts \\n\\nA novel virus can be highly virulent on a new host because the new host has no immunity to combat the virus \\n\\nA novel virus can replicate unchecked within the new host specie because there is no programed immune response to combat the novel viral infection \\n\\nWhen a virus is given the opportunity to replicate unimpeded the probability of a successful mutations increases \\n\\nAs the virus mutates through host replication it may become more virulent on the host \\n\\nIf a virus is overly virulent on its host it often leads to an evolutionary dead end  in other words if all the hosts are killed by a virus the virus wont be able to replicate and will go extinct\\n\\nOver time natural selection tends to favor the mutations that make virus more transmissible over mutations that make it more virulent \\n\\nThe most successful viruses are ones that have evolved to be highly transmissible but have minimal virulent effects on the host \\n\\nSome viruses can be highly virulent on certain individuals in the host population and have no virulent impact on other individuals within the same population \\n\\nOver time the genetic traits in thoes unaffected individuals will be passed along to subsequent generations and become the dominant trait within the host population \\n\\nThis relationship between viruses and their hosts has been ongoing for hundreds of millions of years Its known as an evolutionary arms race \\n\\nViruses have always and will continue to always be one of the selection factors driving the evolution and diversity of species on our planet \\n\\n\\n\\nAgain I tried to make the information very simple and loose I left our a tremendous amount of information in hopes to provide some insight without confusion This is rphysics question\\n\\n10ms to detect muzzle flash and ~250ms to move your head assuming bullet aimed

to discuss your scientific qualifications such a stunning lack academic prowess undoubtedly hindered any feeble attempt at education that you could have potentially mustered while also shining a light on your distaste for the questions here as the first sentence of any question put forward is unlikely to adhere to the academic rigor that you require from others but are clearly unable to obtain for yourself Bitch Speaking as a fly researcher you have to burn your house down sorry Wow thats awful You could sew a horse dick to yourself sure It would probably rot and fall off and probably make you quite sick in the process Acting hurt and waiting until you fall asleep Im pretty sure that the current pandemic has made bats way spookier for many people Yup I think this might be the best observation There are some megataxonomies of viruses that emerged prior to LUCA and their genomes also work with the standard twenty amino acids So while observing that both archaea and bacteria use all twenty may show that at least LUCA used these twenty amino acids that all viruses also use them suggests a far more primitive probably precellular adoption to the twenty amino acids\\n\\nSomeone could argue that its possible that all megataxonomies of viruses only adopted the standard twenty after LUCA and only later evolved towards the current system as a result of evolution So while it seems quite implausible the argument may go that it is at least possible this doesnt prove viruses indicate an earlier origins of the twenty amino acids than LUCA But it turns out that LUCAs own genome is filled with viruses that used the standard twenty amino acids So LUCAs own virome helps confirm an earlier origins of the twenty [See]httpswwwnaturecomarticless415790200408x the new paper

just cooked on the grill 5 days past use date apparently Youre arguing that the endocrine system needs to be lumped in We don’t know but it’s getting farther away as time goes on so well probably never know No but sometimes spores can be toxic so it is recommended to not do this You can touch even the most deadly mushroom and be okay but you do not want want ingest any tissue or spore if you dont know what it is Additionally the spores from magic mushrooms are not what get you high you need to eat the actual mushroom Ok but can I drink it anyway If it’s served cold on a hoy day I probably won’t notice… and I’ll blame the next day diarrhea on the poor choices of snacks I select after the third one… You dont think facts can be used to promote false ideas Thats a simple trick Really appreciate the time and effort put into this It makes perfect sense D Thank you so much So the glucose we get from gluconeogenesis and eating food will be exactly the same in structure however the function of the glucose at any point in time might differ to suit the body’s current needs Gluconeogenesis only occurs when you are low on fuel Hungry\\n\\nIf hungry —> glucose is broken down for energy\\n\\nIf not hungry —> glucose is converted to fuelstorage molecules\\n\\n\\nEXPLANATION \\n\\nWhen you eat a meal but are not starving your body is not short of energy so the food you eat won’t be broken down to produce energy as it would basically be wasted it’s more complicated but is sufficient to explain my point Instead the body converts the glucose into fuelstorage molecules such as glycogen and fat to give the body an emergency fuel source\\n\\nHowever when you are starving your body is low on glucose The body needs to maintain a steady glucose concentration for survival so it produces glucose by gluconeogenesis This glucose has a different function than the glucose we ingest because in this case we are starving and need fuel to survive So instead the glucose is broken down to produce energy for the body So what are particle sizes then In regards to B vitamins Why does your body have to make them small to use them arent molecules already small by default And is PH also important for it to work Nebulizer make the molecules small correct Why is that It doesnt just produce heat but also breaks the substance down kind of like dissolve right One day my eyebrow started

both if you really want to but then you have to have a low strength stat and that just causes even more issues Look its very complicated biology that Im definitely not just making up and I wont do your research for you Gotta post the results if he did that one I would say eating kind but I don’t want to cause something dumb to happen so do not eat them until you know what they are fully and then I’ll say eat them as a joke stay safe Can we get a picture of how it’s growing on the plate 😊 maybe try water flavoring I used to not drink water at all during my 6th grade year cause i thought i tasted nasty and had a sharp texture and mind you at the time i was drinking about 4 liters of pop a day but i saw a ad for Mio and decided to give a try and haven’t had a problem drinking water since Ok thanks My take is this as a westerner who’s used to pronouncing western names read English German etc etc names from eastern countries can be difficult to pronounce It didn’t start because his name was funnyish to begin with a la Benedict Cumberbatch it started because white people can’t put in the effort to pronounce an Indian based name correctly There’s been plenty of tweets and articles written about it that you can look up if you put down your devil’s advocate card for 30 seconds So M Night Shyamalan’s name is not hard to pronounce and if you make that “Shamalamadingdong” reference that a LOT of people do I’m gonna call you a racist Have you checked Libgenis library genesis You might be able to find it there But what bread I’m located in the Middle East if that helps

Your blood cells inherit their DNA from these stem cells\\n\\nIf theres something wrong with your marrow or your blood and you require a transplant youve now got someone elses blood stem cells sitting in your bones making new blood cells The new blood cells will inherit their DNA from the stem cells that made them so now you also have blood cells with the donors DNA in them This doesnt mean all of the DNA in your body is replaced it just means your blood in particular is now a genetic mix of cells containing your own DNA which your own marrow made and cells containing the donors DNA which the donated marrow made\\n\\nThis is true for any organ transplant by the way If you receive a kidney transplant the DNA in that kidney doesnt change to match yours You retain the donors kidney cells with their own DNA for as long as you keep that donated kidney\\n\\nThe title of the article is a little silly with the 5000 miles away thing The distance is irrelevant The cells are sitting right there in your marrow so the change isnt transferred across a distance or anything Yes we do it all the time Thanks so much for completing the survey I understand how hard depression can be although not to the

about that would be warranted It’s personal and should be private but not all employers would respect that Ive read the Wikipedia article they seem like pretty awesome little creatures Especially the bit about them being a sign of a healthy ecosystem surely that should mean the sight of them should be a good thing Their feeding methods are scary but very similar to other predacious insects and the

depending on how lipophilic they are as well as some other properties\\n\\nWhen drugs from the plasma are metabolized more drug generally leaves the tissues and enter into the plasma to maintain the concentration equilibrium You may have to do a genetic test the sex of the bird some vets offer them for free Birds gonads are internal until they need them for mating so you wont be able to tell Unless this species is sexually dimorphic ie males are one color while females are another youd have to get a genetic test done to determine the sex\\n\\nAlso sex and gender are two different things Sex is determined by the individuals reproductive organs While gender is a social construct that revolves how an individual feels or identifies about ones self \\n\\nEdit so OP question answered first How are you so sure they only live a couple of years at most Just because other cephalopods have short life spans does not mean their other relatives do Ravens also have long shaggy neck feathers and

to challenge your stats you linked what is considered a COVID death Because as you remember I hope you know this at the beginning of the pandemic people were dying in car accidents who tested positive

your own emotions but a high IQ alone isnt to blame for it Ignorance usually come with Mary sue Not the other way This is biology sub It wants to tell you the extended auto warranty on your car is expiring If the mods are overwhelmed with moderating they need to reach out and request more people apply This is getting ridiculous Ignoring reports and modmail isnt helping anyone So many factors in this to think about\\n\\n\\nAssuming the absolute best healthcare and the highest motivation of everyone involved in this operation I would guess you have 48 hours max to reattach the main vessels and thats just to get bloodflow back\\n\\nYou must then worry about the rush of metabolites from the oxygen starved appendage likely going straight to your heart lungs and brain and having nasty effects and maybe even throwing your heart into a non perfusing rhythm\\n\\nAssuming this arm is reattached we then can debate on the neurological recovery of the arm which from my understanding is a crap shoot Better the health of the person the better the outcome but no guarantee either way I guess we also should not be multicellular organisms since that was a mutation too Looks like food Fry those up and have yourself a free dinner Never understood why people dont share notes Used to have a Google drive where all the students in class could upload notes interesting articles etc and had a shared Google docs during class where people could write and collaborate lol I tried that on my proposal phase and my professor shot me down hard She doesnt want to hear it Thank you \\] Werent those in starship troopers Yes but what I am asking is to correlate 2 things that are difficult to correlate I think it would be interesting for a few different reasons to see what a “minimum living thing” would look like being sanitary and disinfecting all of your equipment and bottles are the most important steps in making a good home brew Well the cell will either be transfected or lysed \\n\\nTransfection the virus injects its DNA into the cell and has its DNA incorporated into the cell From there the viral genome will remain in the genome until the right time upon which it will be activated begin producing viruses and lyse the cell This can be longterm and take however long it needs for the viral genes to be activated\\n\\nLysing The virus will override the replication machinery of the host cell and redirect that machinery to replicating the viral genome instead of the host genome Tons of viruses will be produced so many that the cell will literally burst and release tons of other viruses\\n\\nNow there is another possible fate It could be the case that the viral genome integrates itself into the genome of a cell but just never gets the chance to ever begin replicating It just kind of stays there Then its possible that when the host cell replicates its own genome a mutation will occur in the viral segment of the genome which will render the viral genome useless If this happens the mutated and therefore dysfunctional viral DNA will sort of just sit there in the host cell DNA forever and the cell will never lyse There are actually huge portions of our own genome just made of up failed viruses which are now dysfunctional after our cellular replication machinery screwed up when it was trying to carefully replicate their genome This is not only true for our genome but true for the genome of virtually every known organism Even the last universal common ancestor LUCA [has a full virome of its own]httpswwwnaturecomarticless415790200408x Some researchers actually once produced a corrective mutation in one of the dysfunctional viruses in our genomes and it started producing viruses again If Im not mistaken there are actually practical relevances to these failed viruses such as in organ transplant Organ transplant from other organisms for humans is best with pigs but researchers are actually working to purge some pig genomes of these failed viruses because they result in compatibility issues when trying to transplant them into our own bodies bleach and any acid really \\n\\n\\nBut for real Dilution is how you avoid this problem It is not hard and you dont need excessive washing A flush or two and your good Back in the day the tribes medicine man would eat the mushrooms then the rest of the tribe would drink his urine for the effect It’s the pink slime McDonald’s makes their nuggets from 😅 Penguins are birds they have feathers For a projectile to do damage it has to be accelerated quickly to a high velocity The explosion that fires a bullet being one example The only other way is to provide sufficient distance that a smaller force can act for longer to achieve that same goal \\n\\n\\nWith a punch the body constrains the distance available and so high acceleration is needed This is limited by how quickly the muscles can contract The amount of excess tension in other muscles is also a retarding factor to that acceleration \\n\\n\\nA punch just using the arm will be quicker but the more powerful punches need to engage the rest of the body which again reduces speed Of course this is dependent on your definition of the punch and when it starts You could theoretically describe the initial body movement as prepunch dynamics are you bloodhounder  What is more strange is that the English word for this German phenomenon is portmanteau which is French It is demonstrative of some of the inconsistent heritage of English\\n\\n[What is also weird is the amount of different types of compound nouns that English is able to form]httpenglishclubcomgrammarnounscompoundhtm I mean it can get flushed out faster if the enzyme responsible for its metabolized is induced This would decrease the drugs half life

pressures the same as any other organism on this planet nonetheless Mutations happen the environment changes and as we’ve all seen this past year diseases burn their way through the population \\n\\nYou gotta think that 9999 of all life on this planet has gone extinct perhaps plastics will be our downfall before climate change I’ve been seeing some studies where immature cetaceans are starving to death because their parents have too much plastic accumulated in their mammary glands Humans are definitely getting dosed with plastics as well as inorganic compounds and those that are

even for humans to quantify somebodies suffering the best way is to ask the patient So good luck asking the insect how he’s holding up Technically yes but not your best psychedelic experience option Ask Ben Franklin Ill disagree with saying dopamine is the cause of addiction Heres my view Addiction is a lock and key If you gave Adderall to a large random sample some would hate it some would not Some fraction would be more mentally effective but not addicted and some would become addicted regardless of any pharmacological benefit\\n\\nAn example I was on morphine for about 2 weeks after serious surgery when I was in my early 20s I was taken off of it fairly suddenly when I went home I had physical withdrawal but didnt realize it and called my doctor with odd symptoms He literally laughed on the phone but didnt say why and gave me a prescription for a tranquilizer for a week or two A few days later a friend explained it So did I crave opiates when I went off or after I found out what happened No Would I have considered it taking it if I could somehow get it free and safely Not even a little I have a life to lead thank you What about years later when I went through chronic depression and had had personal experience or familiarity with more addictive things No never called to me Does that make me better than an addict Absolutely not just lucky in that particular way \\n\\nAs a baseline possibly genetic most people have very low to moderately low vulnerability to addiction but more is fairly common If someone with significant baseline potential is in a situation of chronic pain either physical or emotional their vulnerability goes up rapidly in proportion to the pain\\n\\nEmotional pain can be things people dont even realize is pain because theyve normalized it Low self esteem a bad marriage a sense of failure a phobia or chronic anxiety fear about a large scale issue like climate change or chronic hate at the government women themselves or whatever\\n\\nWhy have addiction rates skyrocketed in the US You dont have to be anyplace on the political spectrum and barely awake to know the problem Suicide and crime rates skyrocketing Obesity and diabetes skyrocketing People hate social media and use it more than ever Ever larger corporations and no privacy The country has been gradually tearing itself apart more and more\\n\\nThere is one and only one trigger for addiction rates climbing ever since The US Vietnam War and 60s social strife up through the current pandemic and strife One trigger increasing chronic individual pain Any coincidence that the steepest climb in addictions lately is in pain medication I think not\\n\\nEdit typos that was my first thought but second one being that the surface must just be very nasty to attract all flies Huh Are you using claims of the supernatural in a biology question\\n\\nThere are no real cases of people teleporting or vanishing Kind of Would like to see a video of bleach killing that stuff Its Limescale build up and cistern blocks Oxygen does exist in water it’s dissolved…and as a fun fact most of the oxygen in our world actually comes from plants in the water but I’m getting side tracked…\\n\\nYou have to consider the structure of gills vs lungs Lungs can get oxygen but water is heavy and you can’t easily get water out of your lungs once it’s in so breathing in and out to get enough oxygen fast enough through water is impossible to meet with the demand but water glides in and out of the gills in fish and has a much bigger surface area to gather a lot of oxygen from it In addition to this fish also don’t need as much oxygen as humans I agree with you here too The data and the information is very complex And the hard conclusions are not completely done yet Anyone saying the science is in walk away Because its not There is a lot being learned as they study the population through this No its an amanita and can poison you I sent the mods a request as others probably have One issue I realized is that those posts did not specifically violate one of the criteria for reporting and rbiology doesnt have any rules itself Not as far as I can tell In fact the opposite may be true people of exceptional intelligence are usually more socially inept and less “connected” to society [deleted] Vodkabeer for the win Not a beer related one but anthrax is one that

haemoglobin for O2… 002 chance it’s a chance but I’m confident with those odds Thats likely but the other explanation is access to sequencing At least in the US the Covid relief bill included funding for sequencing Covid across many patients Sequencing in general has also gotten exponentially cheaper compared to even ten years ago I wouldnt be surprised if the Spanish Flu mutated as quickly but sequencing wasnt invented yet so well never know Considering the seriousness of Covid there are ongoing sequencing efforts in many countries across the globe so just having more eyes on mutations will reveal mutations I think its hard to make a comparison simply because we are dedicating so much effort to just sequencing compared to previous viruses Half the cells in your body are bacteria Kill

my money Hmmm yes \\n\\nstrings I always wondered how that was reconciled along a timeline Thanks for the explanation \\n\\nSpecies concepts are useful for extant organisms for example in wildlife biology  my field but these are always loose definitions Usually we split extant species based on whether two populations are closely related enough to create viable offspring But this is imperfect because of hybrids so a combination of concepts is used For example lions and tigers can reproduce but they would never meet in nature because their geographic ranges don’t overlap also this is an imperfect example because ligers have tons of birth defects Another example would be coyotes and red wolves but anthropogenic habitat modification has caused overlap and hybridization Well he does get his testosterone from ampoules I was told by a horticulturalist that you can put baking soda in water and spray the tree It changes the Ph of the air plant and the kills it but wont hurt the tree That depends on the substance An antibiotic Sure itll eventually be metabolized and excreted Elemental mercury No There is no documented correlation that I’m aware of From the books I’ve read on the subject intelligence is not something that is easily quantifiable If an IQ test is given to two people from separate countries with different cultures the accuracy of the test is going to be way off I believe work has been done to remove some of the cultural bias from IQ tests but it will always have some bias\\n\\nAdditionally if an intelligent person with a social disorder is subjected to a social intelligence test… the results are going to be way off again \\n \\nA person’s intelligence is formed by genes and how those genes interact with their environment Identical twins who are separated at birth and raised in different families will have similarish IQ scores but won’t be the same But can you accept that you could take a few out with you who didn’t wanna die I had bags and bags and bags of those They grew in my yard and basically anywhere there was a pine tree and this was off Spinard road in Anchorage According to Google I’d have to say yeah Liberty cap are they  They

good lol a few people have died of thos red once i only know there name in danish but u get rlly sick and for multible days so its not something youd wanna eat I’m more asking about the fact of how probable failure is Not that I don’t know it happens from this I don’t think you read what I said thoroughly Im more interested in researchlab than environmental or animal and the only major things Ive seen are the issues regarding solely undergrad or masters and PhD job opportunities there seems to be a bottleneck that Ive seen \\n\\nMy professor hated my proposal so Im back to the drawing board still googling But thank you Yes it can make the one who consumes disappear Dont eat it its not a magic mushroom I should check if there was a bar nearby maybe he’s just a little tipsy I think desensitization occurs because of overuse eg desensitized penis from masturbation whereas sensitization comes from something that indirectly triggers an overgeneralized response like ptsd would Or something like that 1 You’d also need remnants of the integrase that enables reversetranscribed DNA to be integrated into the genome\\n\\n2 Your cells are all currently chockfull of mRNA molecules If reverse transcriptase randomly copied and integrated any mRNA hanging around it would be integrating gajillion of pieces of your normal mRNA into your genome which would be really bad for your cells The integrating mechanisms of viruses are often focused on both reverse transcribing and integrating their own DNA specifically\\n\\n3 If it did all that would mean is that the cell is basically like a cell infected with real COVID well a part of it And how do you fight off cells with COVID Your immune system The cell would continue to make spike proteins and the whole way the immune response works is by detecting cells that are making unfamiliar proteins like the spike protein and then killing them Basically your body would kill those cells just like it would fight off any and all normal infections That’s the stuff they make McNuggets with Just chuck it and start over It’s not worth the effort \\n\\nThose flaps are cheap and you’ll get a better deal with a new one anyway Chicken

too bro forgot to say that Happy Halloween Being a biologist is fine as long as you completely stay away from Darwins theory of evolution by means of natural selection \\n\\nIn general the simple reason why it is impossible to falsify the Theory of Natural Evolution using theoretical scientific principles alone is that it is not even a theory not even a proper scientific hypothesis being

testosterone works\\n\\nWill higher levels of testosterone in puberty lead to a deeper voice once puberty is finished Probably\\n\\nWill the amount of testosterone in your body affect your voice after puberty Nope Not one bit\\n\\nYour voice is determined by physical parts of your body that have finished developing by the time you are an adult\\n\\nIts mostly to do with genetics unless you have a case where there is some sort of inhibited testosterone output in the individual to begin with eg castration When youre body has built up an immunity to a virus certain immune cells have developed proteins which can recognise the same viral antigens so they can quickly start destroying the virus Those cells can also send out chemical signals cytokines which can induce a variety of effects on all kinds of cells For example these can increase body temperature increase mucous production constrict airways etc all the common illness symptoms But usually these pass a lot quicker as your immune killer cells can remove the infection at a much quicker rate Pretty fucking ugly Are you under the impression that blind people are retarded There is a hell of a lot more to the electron transport chain than just powering PSI but Im guessing for a highschool Level question that would suffice\\n\\nA little more depth thoughPSI can actually be activated by light in the farred wavelengths which exist in natural sunlight The movement of electrons and breaking of water molecules across the electron transport chain is actually useful in a number of different activities such as ATP production dissipating and storing solar energy to prevent damage this is a main feature of photosystems turning energy into sugars and starches by powering the calvin cycle ATP is produced as a product through excess hydrogen from spiltting water being pushed out of the membrane through a concentration gradiant to produce ATP using ATP synthase \\n\\nYour question is answered in the first section but I

entirely Loading up on immunosuppressants may prevent immunity developing but the mRNA would still be translated You ever seen a bugs life Who you gonna call Also if you could take photos and vids of

need to understand basic immunology Once you have the basics you can fill in details that may be specific to the new topic This way youre only memorizing a small number of details for every topic

running down your legs Disease is a big factor New strains of viruses and bacteria appear or change in frequency every year making pathogenresistance alleles come and go as well almost like yearly fashion trends\\n\\nThere are planktonic animals that make resting stages eg eggs that sink to the bottom of the pond and can stay in suspended animations for several years In [one classic study]httpswwwnaturecomarticlesnature06291 old resting stages of Daphnia along with their pathogens were dug out of the mud and reanimated This is basically like using a time machine to hop back and forth and systematically crossexpose parasites and hosts from different time periods One cool result was that the pathogens tended to be more able to infect Daphnia from the same year showing that pathogens evolve to become especially good at infecting whatever genotypes are in the host population at the moment\\n\\nWeather is another big factor For species that reproduce fast it can even change the population within a single year Theres a really cool study system of wild fruit flies in orchards in North America The researchers working in the orchards have shown that allele frequencies change every year from spring to fall as the weather becomes warmer and warmer favoring genotypes that are good at living in warm conditions the same alleles that are more common farther south in fact Then winter comes and the population is reset as genotypes that are good at handling cold become favored instead So its easy to see how warm years and cold years would have a similar effect My nan

convinced that insects have emotions or at least the more complex ones that allow them to analyze the emotional impact of physical pain There are a few genera that might but I’m not basing that on anything other than random observation I’m no entomologist But it’s an interesting topic Oh good I thought it was nori This it not something I am an expert at its just my current understanding \\n\\nConjugation is the transfer of genetic material through touch In Bacteria this is a very small bit of naked DNA that travels through a specialized appendage The conjugation process of the eukaryote Paramecium is different because like all ciliates Paramecium has two nuclei a large and a small and during conjugation the small nucleus undergoes meiosis and haploid small nuclei are exchanged with the mate Conjugation in the Paramecium results in genetic variation but does not result in additional organisms so it is sexual but it is not reproductive\\n\\nPlasmogamy is the fusion of the protoplasm of two cells they share a cell membrane without a nuclear fusion and I think it is generally used to describe Fungi My understanding is plasmogamy in fungi resulting in the dikaryotic cell is always ultimately followed by a delayed karyogamy From what I can tell the process by which Paramecium trades nuclei involves plasmogamy as well but I dont see the word used in that context so maybe there is some subtlety I am not aware of or a preferred synonym More on this below\\n\\nKaryogamy is the fusion of nuclei\\n\\nSyngamy is the fusion of two haploid gametes to form a diploid cell it is called fertilization in some organisms Plasmogamy and karyogamy are stage 1 and 2 of syngamy and typically progress quickly except in dikaryotic fungi\\n\\nPlasmodial slime molds hatch as unicellular amoebas which are haploid gametes well sometimes and when two sexually compatible amoebas meet they fuse their cytoplasm plasmogamy and nuclei karyogamy together to become a diploid cell syngamy then repeatedly divide their nuclei without cell division to grow to a macroscopic size To my knowledge slimes do not perform conjugation but I have seen that terminology used in older papers Unfortunately it is not always clear when a scientific term is being used to describe analogous or unrelated processes Part of the problem with terminology is words can have drastically different definitions in different fields or even in the same field Guttation exists in plants fungi and slimes but is not an analogous process for example Conjugation likewise describes two very different processes in bacteria and ciliate eukaryotes And so plasmogamy karyogamy and syngamy may not describe identical processes in different types of organisms or may be replaced by other synonyms

happening\\n\\nLike other commenter said there is no end goal Humans will keep evolving as long as there is a need for adaptation Yep you are missing another part of the story Correct the macronutrients are digested into the monomer units and absorbed into the bloodstream However the other part of the story is metabolism Metabolism is highly complex and involves many molecular conversions to produce various molecules the body might need at any one instance \\n\\nA scenario where glucose might be converted to fat is eating food when your body already has sufficient energy If the body has sufficient energy there is no reason to break it down further to produce energy Instead glucose can be converted into glycogen which is a fuelstorage molecule \\n\\nGlycogen stores are limited but fat stores are virtually infinite so if you overeat your body tends to start producing fat stores For creation of fat stores glucose is converted into triglycerides basically fat and it is stored as fat in your body Is this a thing Making a tea out of it and drink the pee [deleted] If my grandmother was suffering and it was the only way I would honor her by ending her suffering if she

alcohol in moderation after getting natural immunity affect you from getting reinfected Plants use only about 1 of absorbed water for photosynthesis According to Law of Limiting Factors the rate of the reaction is determined by the factor available at suboptimal levels Now when water is so scarce water stress causes the stomata to close and hence reduces CO2 availability water stress also causes the leaves to wilt and reduces their metabolic activity So the effect of water as a factor is more through its effect on the plant rather than directly on photosynthesis It seems like it’s the same

researching though I by no means have a definitive answer to this i did There are hundreds of thousands of compounds that kill pathogens such as HIV The problem is that most of also kill or harm your

suited to deal with getting oxygen from water You can get water into lungs easy but not so much getting it out…and in order to take another breathe you need to get it out so you drown because you can’t keep up with the demand You would need to breathe an ungodly amount of water per second to get enough oxygen and lungs just can’t do that Make me mod and I will delete every post that has to do

But Id rather not take my chances with any of them Ive watched too much Man Vs Wild to try He sounds really cynical and like he doesn’t believe his patients Or that he’s already got a conclusion in mind and is out to DISPROVE NDEs When we set out with a bias it’s difficult to conduct experiments without bringing that bias along \\nI listened to most of the 300 episodes of a NDE podcast over the last several years I find it fascinating because everyone’s experience is unique but they all flow very similarly Regardless of gender race location culture or creed  people have extremely similar “spiritual” experiences when they experience an NDE or psychoactive compound Whether it’s LSD where eyes are open or DMT with closed eyes while seeing more vividly than ever imagined…the experiences are so strikingly similar With DMT why would people see the same “entities” even if they’ve never heard reference of them beforehand I’m not saying that with DMT you go off on an astral trip and meet interdimensional beings But what IS happening HOW are our humans brains so alike that we hallucinate the exact same ridiculous looking things in an altered state How have people completely healed themselves from addictions after “meeting Mother Auyhuasca” How is that we can consume a substance that causes us to dig into the depths of our psyche and rearrange things so that we can function more easily and understand the world more clearly There is insurmountable evidence if more than a few scientists would study it and if it wasn’t so damn Taboo to talk about \\n\\nIt’s precisely because it’s considered woowoo that there isn’t more indepth research on the topic or at least not that the public is allowed to know about It’s precisely why psilocybin DMT LSD and even cannabis have been deemed schedule 1 drugs Because it usually changes the way we see the world It usually causes us to “wake up” from this dumb broken system we’ve created Why does it do that Well we don’t really NEED to understand the why to see that it does regardless of our understanding But I do believe we will understand it better someday Whatever it is it IS scientific and it just IS the way things are Either we as humans have the ability to hallucinate the same experiences and exact images as strangers across the globe or it’s a spiritual experience suggesting that there is way more than just this earthly plane of existence It’s one of those two things and they are both really freaking cool If science helps discover the truth and if spirituality is also the truth then I expect in the future we will come to accept that they complement each other well But there is no room for religion not even the “religion” of faith in science because it’s still done by man’s hand when it comes to progress

a good sport Remember that at the end of the day the known risks associated with the vaccine and there are less than your friend seems to believe according to the research are quantifiably far lower

in some cases but even if they do fight it so well they don’t feel ill they can still be a carrier\\nIn being a carrier they can now spread it to someone notsohealthy or worse it could mutate within

some general cell biology courses like 15 years ago and Im like dude I analyze bodily fluids for a living > I believe that each planet has a different thematic an idea where their habitants behave differently not every alien will behave like an animal or a human they will behave beyond our understanding\\n\\nYeah or not If the planet they evolved on is similar to Earth they might evolve very similar biology too just from a different starting points There are many organisms on Earth that arent closely related like a shark and a dolphin that look and move in similar ways because theyve adapted to a similar lifestyle We should expect the same thing to happen when we imagine life on other planets\\n\\n> This great difference in nature requires a Brand new term for beings that behave

slug at about 335 ms and if we are goint to take the 2s reaction time from the first article as our standard that means we need to be about 67m away to have any time at all to move and we need to add on the amount of time and therefore distance we need to actually do the moving A 12 gauge shotgun slug is about 18mm accross so lets say thats how far you need to move your hand to not get hit How long does it take someone to move their hand 18mms I have no idea and no clue how Id find that out but Id bet its not very long Lets call it a tenth of a second not including reaction time So that gives us a range of about 99m All of this is assuming of course that you only notice the shot when it just leaves the barrel It doesnt take into account the tiny bits of time it takes for a trigger pull to translate into a hammer strike and the travel down the barrel which would give you more time\\n\\nx200B\\n\\nSo if someone shoots at the edge of your body with a slow shotgun slug from across a football field yeah probably Looking it up some a 12 gauge is still accurate at that range but with a significantly decreased amount of force so your dodge is probably helpful if you pick the right

because its hard to quantify There are multiple types of intelligence and within those types there are subtypes Is general intelligence simply the average of ones different types of intelligence I feel like intelligence may be impossible to quantify with the limited information that we can gather about someone For example Nickola Tesla was an intelligent individual but he was also delusional and had problems forming relationships which suggests that he had a low emotional intelligence Therefore I would say Tesla was in fact of average intelligence even though he was a very noteworthy individual who advanced various fields of science Perhaps intelligence can be defined by ones contributions to society but even that leaves a lot to be desired Can anyone recommend a book about what intelligence actually is Because Id be very interested in others thoughts on the subject Its everyones personal choice Most people I know did not have this reaction But what I will tell you is the rare bunch of us that did there is absolutely no help or acceptance whatsoever The top people in the US in the medical industry have no fucking clue what to do And the VICP program has left us for

Aerobic organisms derive most of their energy from respiration which on a cellular level involves the use of O2 and glucose to generate ATP a currency of life CO2 is created as a waste product and must be removed from cells This occurs by the CO2 diffusing into the blood where as others have noted it forms carbonic acid The blood carries this to the lungs where its released and diffused across the alveolar membrane in the alveoli and is exhaled Based on this if CO2 1 Was not generated during respiration very little ATP would be created and the organism would die 2 CO2 was not carried into the blood same result 3 If CO2 levels rise in the blood pH would change and enzymes would not function correct resulting in death 4 Similar scenarios would occur if the CO2 was not taken to the lungs and exhaled There are more details to this but this is the essence of what would happen none of it good Parasites cant even survive on their own much less reproduce If viruses arent considered living for that reason does that mean parasites arent living\\n\\nFire uses energy and reproduces itself as long as it has access to fuel food Does that make fire a living thing This is amanita muscaria also

If they are collective it has to first be broken down into individual atoms so the b vitamins have to be separated from the fillers otherwise if it gets directly into the body you wont be able to use it\\n\\n3 So a Nebulizer breaks them down the atoms vitamins and fillers in supplement into small enough particle size your lungs can absorb but the fillers are still attached to the vitamins so can your lungs then separate them as it does with oxygen in air Even pure B vitamin like just b12 and alcohol because alcohol is not produced by the body so once in the blood directly from injection together with b12 it will not do separate them as your body doesnt recognize alcohol which has changed the structure of the b12 which also changed the b12 into a big particle size Therefore it has to go trough the gut system But my idea here is WHAT IF the lungs similarly to the gut can also separate them into individual pieces as in detach the vitamins and recognize the essentialness of it therefore absorb it into the blood while exhaling the fillers I guess your body absorbs everything including the fillers because it does when people smoke nicotine which isnt found in the body naturally But the main thing here is that your lungs can separate the vitamins from the fillers once the nebulizer has made them into a small particle size If the vitamin has other non natural supplement in there with the vitamin that your body doesnt have inside of itself naturally then your body wont able to use and separate the vitamin from the filler whatever it is When you add a filler depending on what it will most of the time attach clump together with the vitamin making it unusable and big therefore the oxygen is also clumped in with other stuff in the air so before they go into the blood as you inhaled the air your lungs separate them individually because things like nitrogen etc are not made by the body naturally or exepection Have public schools failed our children There are alot of rediculas questions on Reddit Aaaaaaaam pretty sure thats not\\n how it works 😅 Elegant little beetle Banana for scale I’m a man child if that counts The trick is to work for Raytheon or Lockheed so you can be the one doing the killing Wait no dont even think to eat this vibrant colored mushrooms are ussualy poisonous Mythbusters was checking this and humans reaction is just too slow to doge bullet I never said you would either lol I’m merely stating that I personally wouldn’t  Glorify the creation Thanks again for your generous spirit Looks like a somewhat heavy lift but as a bibliophile it’s what I seek This sub has no active mods 3 and 8 taught something a hard lesson Assassin beetle Forbidden cotton candy \\nEat with caution i have chronic inflamation in my chest that is indeed no fun  wow Im sorry you went through that I completed it for you \\nI have the MTHFR gene mutation While its not life threatening for me it caused lifelong depression So I would be in favor of correcting that gene defect Came here to say mostly the same thing you did but your part 3 did give me an idea If we could utilize reverse transcriptase to make an mRNA vaccine that inserted the spike protein code into our genetic code then our cells could regularly produce antigens possibly acting as our own passive boosters to viruses Now yes there are a lot of specific nuances to this idea but thats what research is for right Some issues to consider how to ensure that the new antigen gene gets put in a safe spot of our genome not splitting important genes ensuring regular but not too active transcription would it lead to a sort of tolerance to the antigen causing our bodies to no longer react to the antigen Probably much easier said than done but hey its an idea Looks like a Sun Conure They can only be sexed by surgery at a veterinary clinic Unless she starts laying eggs Then you’ll know Old They have a short lifespan Fish with legs and a malformed crab No need to thank me Also if you could take photos and vids of what’s actually going on in the world let alone your own country then you wouldn’t be making yourself look like a tool Sounds like an exwife Glanced at his wiki and he doesnt seem like a biologist and seems very biased at that I wouldnt trust him as a credible source but then again im going off a wiki and never heard of the guy till now lol Put it in the freezer Its well into fall now Its bc of the color What if it was windy Homosexual AND incest It might be a tree burl Theyre like tree tumors lol thats a pretty crow If extreme gastric distress is magical then yes I agree its interesting but you should take a lot of those reports with a grain of salt The more we study things the more we find there are natural explanations for them\\n\\nHere is a [great post]httpsthenesscomneurologicablogindexphpstudyingneardeathexperiences from a neurologist on NDEs excerpt below\\n\\n>That NDEs occur is not controversial – many people report remembering experiences around the time of cardiac arrest from which they were revived Typical experiences include a sense of floating outside of one’s body even looking down upon oneself and the events going on Some people report a bright light and others report “passing over” and being greeted by deceased lovedones The experience is often peaceful or euphoric which contrasts to the way people feel when they eventually wake up Surviving a cardiac arrest takes its toll and is not a pleasant experience\\n\\n>The question is not whether or not people have such experiences – the question is how to interpret them Just as even the most rigorous skeptic does not question that people see UFOs but rather what the UFOs likely are\\n\\n>The burden of proof for anyone claiming that NDEs are evidence for the survival of the self beyond the physical function of the brain is to rule out other more prosaic explanations This burden has not been met\\n\\n>Neuroscientists are piecing together plausible explanations for each of the components of the NDE The sensation of floating outside one’s body can be reliably induced by suppressing that part of the brain that makes us feel as if we possess our bodies The experience is identical to that reported by those who have had an NDE This experience can be replicated by drugs or magnetic stimulation There are even reports I have had one such patient of people who have a typical NDE experience during seizures The bright light can be explained as a function of hypoxia relative lack of oxygen either to the retina or the visual cortex Any everything else is simply the culturally appropriate hallucinations of a hypoxic brain This is the class that made me a microbiology major I loved this class when I took it at my college Whoa Thats crazy looking I have no idea what it is but Im very curious I will ate it i like mango 9 34 tabs oughta do it Oh\\n\\nI heard Canadians were really Kind to all the Native Life what year was that and was it chickens treated with or without antibiotics If by magic you mean itll kill ya then sure\\n\\nAlways avoid mushrooms that look like Super Mushrooms from Mario And wash your hands after handling this Thought this shit was some napoleon ice cream bruh Nano pillars deform bacterial cell membrane and can even penetrate it entirely in some cases causing the cell to rupture on the wing surface It was first discovered on cicada wings and similar structures were later observed on on dragonflies and damselflies Translating this type of nanoscale architecture to synthetic surfaces for biomaterial implant applications is what I work on professionally You’re completely right I had the entire mechanism backwards in my head I guess I’m rusty on my metabolic terms 😅 Can this mf be banned please literally just clogging up the sub with completely irrational questions ranging from mildly annoying to think about it for approximately 20 milliseconds and get the answer Mad scientist joined them up to make a caterpillar centipede Fact Forbidden stroopwafels It is an Arnoldeus Swortsinaggereous Usually sent by an ex girlboyfriend after they say Ill be baaack\\n\\nOr an assassin bug Good for controlling pests but best to leave them alone Ok I know you’re doing this fun and ridiculous trolling with ridiculous questions thing but so far they’ve been at least tenuously related to biology What’s up with this one Just another Tuesday Yup looks like allenii or cyan to me A bit earthy at first but then it gets spicy I think its an assasin bug No \\n\\nThe force of your legs pushing against the rock will push the rock away from you and toward the ground \\n\\nThere is no force opposing your push against the rock so there will not be any force contributing to you “jumping again” \\n\\nYou will continue to fall and the rock will approach the ground more quickly\\n\\nNot sure what this has to do with biology this is perhaps better suited for the physics sub It’s perished At least partially Firmly grab both sets of wings and pull in opposite directions to usher him across I mean it could be that her mothers CYP3A enzyme was an ultrarapid metabolizer which would decrease the half life of birth control This would be genetic Or her mother didnt take it properly or there was a drug interaction\\n\\nThere could also be pharmacodynamic effects where her mother had less receptors for the birth control drug or some other reason it didnt cause as great an effect but where the drug half life is unaffected\\n\\nBut drug metabolism and this interindividual variation in pharmacodynamics is partly genetic Yeah I have to investigate Many have suggested that it could be Pectinatus which typically appears at the packaging stage I did test my wort and yeast and those were clean I suspect the contamination must have happened during packaging You don’t have to be an asshole Not likely If that was possible schizophrenia could in general be diagnosed that way Shove it up your ass and see what happens I mean I would take care in what is really being said by various sources the most accurate take would probably be neutral on the issue at hand and would not be showing any bias ie there are a number of hypotheses for why these behaviors occur and there is at least some evidence which agrees with each however this is an area which requires more study \\n\\nA few of these sources are not scientific sources at all and a few seem to indicate bias to me those included bias does not necessarily mean homophobia though it is in some cases when I say that I mean for example animals arent intelligent or they dont really know what theyre doing type arguments \\n\\nResearch shows many are more intelligent than we thought and many are certainly widely understood to be intelligent enough that you cant act like your conclusion encompasses all nonhuman species great apes are kind of notorious in this discussion especially bonobos Im not an expert but Im pretty sure the body produces blood on demand Thats why you can donate blood several times a year without eventually dying is it missing its jaw 1 Technically you can do anything you want but I would rather not get involved in the ethics of advertising the sale of bodily fluids So to answer people can well breast milk for a high price for a short time after getting vaccinated and advertise it as having antibodies sure they could but whether or not its entirely accurate or safe without proper testing remains to be seen Thats a whole other rabbit hole that Id rather not comment on\\n\\n2 No For the long explanation newborns have special receptors on their intestinal lumenlining that allow for the absorption of special nutrients including antibodies from the breast milk of the mother These receptors allow for proper absorption and circulation of intact antibodies from the mother into the child After a period of time with aging these receptors go away in the adolescentadult so drinking breast milk from a recently vaccinated woman would not be beneficial in fighting COVID19 in the adult patient He doesnt want to and is looking for excuses All the answers he wants are easily available he never looked and prefers to listen to gossip \n"
